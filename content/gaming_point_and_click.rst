Back to the Clicks
------------------

2025 unexpectedly turned out to be my personal Year of the Adventure Game. Point-and-clicks have never really been my favorite genre — I’ve played a few here and there over the years, but I wouldn’t call myself a die-hard fan. Still, something clicked (pun intended) this year. Maybe it was nostalgia, maybe a desire to fill in the glaring gaps in my gaming education, but I dove headfirst into the golden age of adventure gaming.

I decided it was finally time to acquaint myself with the genre’s legendary titles — the ones I missed, the ones I never finished, and the ones that still sit on the throne of pixel-hunting prestige. The 1990s were, after all, not just the heyday of RTS games, but also the era of adventure games — the rise and fall of the mighty Sierra, the Disney-level charm of LucasArts, and the often-overlooked gems like Westwood's Kyrandia trilogy, which, to this day, remains my personal favorite.

Back in the day, I watched my father play Laura Bow, Police Quest, the early Monkey Island titles. I later finished Monkey Island 3 and 4, King’s Quest VI–VIII, Space Quest VI, Spielberg’s The Dig, and of course the untouchable Full Throttle. Grim Fandango? Wrapped that one up a few years ago. Leisure Suit Larry? Missed that train — didn’t know the subscription code from Komsomolskaya Pravda, sadly.

But by the early 2000s, my interest in the genre waned, and I skipped most of the big names: The Longest Journey, Syberia, even Deponia — which I hadn’t even heard of until recently. Over time though, the indie scene slowly lured me back in. Thimbleweed Park, Unusual Findings, Fran Bow, Slender Threads — they reignited that spark.

So in this article, I’m diving into the games I revisited, the classics I finally conquered, and the new discoveries that surprised me. Some held up. Some... not so much. But all of them helped me see just why the genre has endured — and where it still has room to grow.


Syberia: Beauty in Slow Motion
------------------------------

Syberia is a game I’ve bounced off before, and after finally finishing the first part this year… I sort of see why. Don’t get me wrong — Benoît Sokal’s art direction is undeniably gorgeous. The game looks like a dream: soft melancholy, desaturated palettes, hauntingly serene towns suspended in time. And the atmosphere absolutely works — it’s heavy with loss, longing, and the quiet dignity of old ideals refusing to die.

But playing it? That’s a bit trickier.

The narrative leans hard into realism, emotional trauma, and socio-psychological themes. And while I usually enjoy dark and introspective stories, Syberia left me feeling more drained than immersed. I guess I was hoping for something a bit more fantastical, surreal, or at least occasionally funny. Instead, it felt like trudging through a very polite existential crisis in slow motion.

And speaking of trudging — the backtracking in this game is insane. There’s no way to skip travel between locations, which means you’ll be watching the same long walks over and over and over again. Yes, yes — I get it. It’s symbolic. The journey is the point. The endless walking reinforces the game’s themes: the fading beauty of the world, the price of devotion, the fragility of dreams in a world that’s forgotten how to dream. But you know what else is fragile? My time.

Because as much as I respect the emotional depth and aesthetic vision, there’s also a real-world player on the other side of the screen — one who would really appreciate a fast travel button or, at the very least, the ability to double-click to make Kate Walker hustle a little.

Still, I’m committed — I’ll finish the rest of the series for this article. And despite all my complaints, I have to admit: there’s something undeniably beautiful in Syberia’s slow, deliberate unraveling. It’s a game that wants you to feel — to linger, to notice, to reflect. It may not be the most player-friendly experience, but it is a meaningful one.

So would I recommend it? Actually, yes — especially if you, too, are quietly wading through some internal fog, unsure where your train is headed. Syberia might not offer answers, but it will walk beside you in silence, through snow-covered streets and dying dreams, until you’re ready to move on.

Kyrandia Series: Potions, Madness and Perspective Shifts
Out of all point-and-click adventures, The Legend of Kyrandia 2: Hand of Fate might be my absolute favorite. There's just something magical about wandering a surreal, dreamlike fantasy realm as Zanthia — a sharp-tongued alchemist with a flair for both fashion and sarcasm. The potion crafting was a brilliant mechanic, encouraging exploration and experimentation. It felt like a fairytale gone slightly mad, but in the best way possible. The first game, while charming in its darker Märchen-esque atmosphere, did get bogged down by that labyrinth — the one you still resent to this day. And the third? Well, when you put a court jester in the lead role, of course the tone shifts toward slapstick. But what’s interesting is that it also flips the narrative: good and evil blur, and the story gains surprising philosophical depth. Not bad for a game where your main weapon is jokes.

Full Throttle: Rock, Rebels and Razorblades
This game is perfect. I’m not even going to pretend to be objective. Full Throttle has everything: unforgettable characters, stunning animation, sharp dialogue, and a soundtrack that still revs in my head like a chopper tearing down the highway. It's gritty, it's loud, and it’s got more soul than most modern games combined. I’ve replayed it three times over the years, and every time it hits the same. Ben, Ripburger, Mo — they're more than just characters; they're icons. And that biker bar fight to the strains of hard rock? Pure catharsis. Tim Schafer, you glorious bastard.

The Dig: Thoughtful Sci-Fi With a Big Heart
People argue about The Dig, and I get it — it’s slower, more contemplative, and less funny than its LucasArts siblings. But that’s why I liked it. It came out around the same time the world was obsessed with Armageddon and space-catastrophes, and it scratched that itch for a high-concept, emotional sci-fi adventure. There's no snark, no pirates, no chainsaw trees — just three astronauts stuck on a desolate alien world, trying to figure out ancient technology and their place in the universe. It felt adult, in a way most games didn’t back then. And sometimes you just want your point-and-click with a side of existentialism.

Monkey Island 3 & 4: Yo Ho Ho and a Barrel of Voodoo
The Curse of Monkey Island was pure gold — a Saturday morning cartoon soaked in rum and bad decisions. The art style? Immaculate. The voice acting? Spot on. And who among us hasn’t caught themselves humming the insult swordfighting theme (“You fight like a dairy farmer!”)? Sure, the jungle mazes and instant snake-death traps were mildly traumatic, but they were part of the charm. The fourth game, Escape from Monkey Island, dabbled in 3D — which drew some ire — but I personally found it retained much of the humor and heart from the previous entry. It may not be perfect, but it’s still Monkey Island, damn it. Also, yes, I have the remasters and Return to Monkey Island in my backlog. They're not going anywhere — just waiting for a rainy weekend and a mug of grog.

King’s Quest VII: The Princeless Bride — Disney With Dead Ends
Sierra adventures are… an acquired taste. Their logic is sometimes twisted, their puzzles unfair, and their design occasionally sadistic. But King’s Quest VII had atmosphere. The vibrant, almost Disney-esque animation (if Disney was okay with death screens every five minutes) and that bizarre mix of whimsy and doom made it memorable. I remember the owl — yes, that owl — sitting solemnly on a branch as if judging me for every wrong move. And yet, despite the occasional “why did I just die from looking at a lake?” moment, it pulled me in. You felt like you were on an epic fantasy journey. And for a 90s kid, that meant everything.

Space Quest 6: Absurdity in Space, with Style
I adore Space Quest 6. It’s one of those games that walks the tightrope between “absurdist parody” and “genuinely clever sci-fi.” It's like Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy had a pixelated cousin. The puzzles were quirky, the settings ridiculous, and the humor consistently weird — but warm. The 3D-ish interface was janky, and some parts felt like fever dreams, but it worked. I played the fifth one too, but mostly watched my dad finish it — so credit where it’s due, the man had taste.

Space Quest V & VI: Starfaring With a Mop and a Microscope
Space Quest VI was the one I played myself — and it left a mark. The game is packed with absurd humor and goofy sci-fi nonsense, the kind you’d expect from a mix of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and Red Dwarf, and I absolutely loved that tone. But what really stuck with me was the whole "journey through the human body" sequence. It felt incredibly imaginative, especially for a kid who had just seen stuff like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. Walking through someone's organs in low-res glory? That’s childhood trauma in the best sense of the word.

As for Space Quest V, I remember trying to play it, but it was ultimately my father who finished it. It’s possible the lack of Russian localization at the time was part of the reason I bounced off — my English wasn’t quite ready for interstellar command back then. Still, I vividly recall the Star Trek parody vibes, the mop-wielding janitor-turned-captain, and the sheer joy my dad had navigating that pixelated galaxy. Even though sci-fi wasn’t exactly his thing, the game’s charm clearly worked its way in.

Police Quest III: Protocols and Puzzles
Speaking of my dad, he was really into the earlier Police Quest games — the ones where if you didn’t file the right report or check your gun, you’d get sacked or shot. He was an engineer, not a cop, but even he appreciated the realism. I tackled Police Quest III myself not long ago, and I was surprised at how well it held up. The setting was great — sunny California with a layer of grit. The puzzles were satisfying, even if they occasionally relied on real-life police procedures that aren’t exactly intuitive without a guide or… well, a badge. It's also fascinating that real law enforcement officers helped design these games. Imagine that happening today.

King’s Quest V & VI: Somewhere between childhood awe and adult frustration
My memories of these two are a bit entangled — I’m pretty sure I played King’s Quest VI myself and passed it, while V was likely something my father tackled. But what I do remember clearly is the mix of wonder and irritation both games delivered. The hand-painted backgrounds were magical, like flipping through a dusty old fairytale book. There were talking owls, haunted towers, mechanical islands, and death. So. Much. Death.
Sierra’s logic was still delightfully twisted — solve a riddle or perish, forget to pick up an item six screens ago and congrats, you're screwed. But somehow that was part of the charm. VI especially felt more polished and emotionally resonant — like an actual fantasy adventure with heart. I didn’t always understand what I was doing or why, but damn if it didn’t feel like a journey worth remembering.

Bad Mojo: A Weird Crawl Into Your Childhood Psyche
I remember trying to play Bad Mojo when I was younger, and it left quite the impression on me — just not the good kind. The idea of being trapped inside the body of a cockroach was definitely intriguing, but, frankly, I just couldn't get past the beginning. The gameplay felt weird and cumbersome, and the puzzles were obtuse even for an eager child. It’s one of those games that, when you try it again as an adult, you wonder if it's worth revisiting or if it will remain a strange memory locked away. The atmosphere is unique, and there’s a certain morbid curiosity in exploring a world from such an uncomfortable perspective. However, I'm not sure I'll be revisiting it anytime soon. Sometimes, the most unusual games aren’t the ones that hold up over time.

The Ones That Got Away (But Not Without a Stare)
There were also plenty of point-and-click gems I wanted to play, but didn't get far — mostly because of the double combo of no Russian translation and the kind of puzzles that made you feel like you were solving quantum physics with a potato. Discworld, Loom, Simon the Sorcerer, Inherit the Earth, Last Express — all of them launched with great promise, captivating intros, quirky characters… and then came that first real puzzle, in pure English, layered with British sarcasm or poetic abstraction. My childhood self stared at the screen like a deer caught in a Monty Python sketch. A murder mystery on a train? Sounded exciting! But if you don’t know the word "compartment," good luck solving anything. These games sat in my memory like unopened treasure chests — gleaming, mysterious, and far too heavy for my tiny linguistic toolkit.

Myst
When Myst first came out, I remember being in awe of its visuals — the detailed, mysterious worlds, the atmosphere of isolation and discovery. However, the gameplay, with its cryptic puzzles and lack of direct guidance, left me frustrated. Even with a solution guide in hand, I couldn’t fully immerse myself in the game. It felt like an insurmountable wall, especially since Myst's world seemed like it held such potential. Strangely, it’s a bit like Syberia in that sense; while I appreciate the visual charm of both games, Myst left me with a kind of "trauma." It set expectations too high for puzzle-based adventure games, and no matter how much I tried, Syberia never quite had the same visual impact, even with its beautiful, intricate designs.

The 7th Guest
On the other hand, The 7th Guest was much more accessible. Though I didn’t finish it, I remember enjoying it significantly more. The pseudo-3D visuals were fascinating at the time, and the horror elements — ghosts, eerie puzzles — made it far more engaging for me. The story of the mansion and its haunting secrets stuck with me. It wasn't as brutally difficult as Myst, and while the puzzles were tricky, the atmosphere of the game was much more friendly and inviting. Those memorable ghost characters, each with their own little quirks, left a lasting impression. Even though I didn’t finish the game, I remember fondly exploring its dark corners.

The 11th Hour
The 11th Hour was a different story. I was excited to try it, but it never quite ran on my computer at the time. So, I only caught glimpses of it, but it left me with a sense of “what could have been.” It was a follow-up to The 7th Guest, but I think the technical limitations and perhaps the game's complexity made it a bit more inaccessible for me back then.

Later on, Phantasmagoria would come around, and I would find it the ultimate expression of Sierra’s ambition, even if it felt like it was a bit too much for them. Still, The 7th Guest was an exciting step in video game technology for me, and it felt like a natural evolution of the medium.

Grim Fandango: Style Over Polycount
Look, Grim Fandango is a good game. The noir Day of the Dead aesthetic? Iconic. The dialogue? Deliciously clever. But I’ll say it — it would've aged better in 2D. Those early polygon models just don’t hold up the way crisp hand-drawn art does. It’s not that the 3D was bad for its time — it was revolutionary. But when you look at Monkey Island 3 or King’s Quest VII, they still look like gorgeous animated films. Grim looks like a tech demo with an incredible script. Still, worth playing. Manny Calavera deserves that.


Sam & Max Hit the Road: Point-and-Click Perfection
Sam & Max Hit the Road is the kind of game that reaffirms your faith in classic point-and-click adventure titles. Everything about it works: the humor, the characters, the art style, and, of course, the puzzles. It’s absurd in all the right ways, and you can’t help but fall in love with the chaos Sam and Max bring to the table. I played it on streams, and every moment was a joy — each scene more ridiculous than the last, yet all tied together with an unrelenting charm. The humor never feels forced; it's as if the game was written by a group of people who knew exactly how to make a game funny without trying too hard. And let’s be real, LucasArts at their best knows how to weave storytelling and puzzles in a way that makes you feel smart for solving them while also laughing at the nonsense along the way. 9.5/10. A true classic.

Beneath a Steel Sky: A Wasted Opportunity in a Retro Package
Beneath a Steel Sky had me expecting a lot more than it ended up delivering. While I can overlook the outdated graphics and even the pixel-hunting puzzles, what really soured the experience for me was the story — or, more accurately, the lack of it. The plot feels disjointed, and the game fails to give any real motivation or clarity on why you’re doing what you’re doing. Am I escaping a building? Am I fighting a system? Why am I not hiding or at least being more cautious about my interactions? The protagonist feels less like a character and more like an avatar for the player, making decisions with no logical basis. There's no development or reflection, and the narrative is weak at best. It feels like a missed opportunity to tell a compelling cyberpunk story. And the constant backtracking and back-and-forth between levels? Utterly frustrating. It’s a game that should have been much better given its setting and potential, but, sadly, it’s more of a “because I can” kind of game rather than something worth playing for its own merits. Unfortunately, I can’t recommend it. It’s the reason why this game never reached the same iconic status as other 90s classics.

Runaway: The Pixel Hunt Diaries
-------------------------------

I went into Runaway completely blind — I hadn’t even heard of it before I started playing. And you know what? I was pleasantly surprised. The visual style has a slick, Saturday morning cartoon vibe, the narrative is enjoyably pulpy, and the whole thing oozes that early-2000s “we just discovered Flash animation” charm. It’s like Road Trip: The Game, if your road trip involved gangsters, conspiracies, and the world’s most oblivious nerd-turned-action-hero.

What really sells it, though, is the tone. Runaway embraces the absurd with confidence: a Californian physics student suddenly neck-deep in mafia trouble, an exotic dancer with a heart of gold, a glam-rock transvestite band, cartoonishly evil Russian mobster, and a tribe of very politically incorrect Native American villains. It’s all a bit much — and that’s exactly why it works. The humor’s got bite, the palette pops, and the whole thing carries that playful energy you’d expect from a lost LucasArts cousin who partied a bit too hard in Madrid.

The puzzles? Well, they try to be logical — and sometimes they are. But more often than not, they veer into that old-school adventure game territory where the solution makes sense only if you’ve been raised by moon logic and trained by monks of the Sacred Order of RTFM.

But my real beef with Runaway isn’t the writing or even the puzzles. It’s the pixel hunting. Dear developers: if your game includes objects that are two pixels wide and the exact same color as the background — that’s not a puzzle. That’s an eye exam.

I’m not asking for modern conveniences like item highlighting or hint systems that hold your hand. But if you’re going to hide key items so well they make Where’s Waldo look like a tutorial, at least give players some kind of in-world logic or visual clue. Instead, I found myself scouring each screen like a desperate raccoon rifling through a 240p dumpster.

Still, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy myself. Runaway has charm. It tries, and mostly succeeds, to evoke that old LucasArts feel — even if it occasionally stabs itself in the foot with its own design choices. And let’s be honest: for all its flaws, I still cared enough to finish it and line up part two. That says something.



Broken Sword: The Da Vinci Code We Actually Wanted
--------------------------------------------------

Broken Sword is adventure gaming at its finest. Right from the opening scene of The Shadow of the Templars, it grabs you with its rich European atmosphere, clever conspiracies, and that irresistible Indiana-Jones-meets-Asterix vibe. A terrorist bombing at a Parisian café? Of course. Ancient secrets buried beneath cobblestone streets? Naturally. Talking to a clown who may or may not be a murderer? Absolutely.

I remember dabbling in the second game back in high school — my sister's boyfriend lent me the disc. I didn’t get to really dive into it at the time, more due to a lack of opportunity than interest. But now, coming back to it with fresh eyes, I finally see what all the fuss was about.

The first two games are near-perfect examples of how to do point-and-click right. The visuals are charmingly hand-drawn with a European comic book aesthetic, the dialogue is witty without being obnoxious, and — praise be — the puzzles actually make sense. It feels polished, intentional, and just damn fun.

Then came the 3D era.

Somewhere around the third and fourth installments, the series took a nosedive into early-2000s polygon hell. Gone were the cozy 2D backgrounds and expressive sprites, replaced by stilted character models, clunky tank controls, and platforming sequences that made you question your life choices. It felt like someone tried to remake Broken Sword as an awkward Tomb Raider clone, minus the flexibility, budget, or spatial awareness.

Thankfully, the fifth game brought the series back to its 2D roots, and while not quite reaching the heights of the original, it was a welcome course correction.

Despite its misadventures in the third dimension, Broken Sword remains one of the most consistent and enjoyable adventure series out there. It respects your time, your brain, and your love of ancient mysteries. I’m glad I finally gave it the attention it deserves — better late than polygonal.
