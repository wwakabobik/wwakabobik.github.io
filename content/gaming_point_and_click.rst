Back to the Clicks
------------------

2025 unexpectedly turned out to be my personal Year of the Adventure Game. Point-and-clicks have never really been my favorite genre — I’ve played a few here and there over the years, but I wouldn’t call myself a die-hard fan. Still, something clicked (pun intended) this year. Maybe it was nostalgia, maybe a desire to fill in the glaring gaps in my gaming education, but I dove headfirst into the golden age of adventure gaming.

I decided it was finally time to acquaint myself with the genre’s legendary titles — the ones I missed, the ones I never finished, and the ones that still sit on the throne of pixel-hunting prestige. The 1990s were, after all, not just the heyday of RTS games, but also the era of adventure games — the rise and fall of the mighty Sierra, the Disney-level charm of LucasArts, and the often-overlooked gems like Westwood's Kyrandia trilogy, which, to this day, remains my personal favorite.

Back in the day, I watched my father play Laura Bow, Police Quest, the early Monkey Island titles. I later finished Monkey Island 3 and 4, King’s Quest VI–VIII, Space Quest VI, Spielberg’s The Dig, and of course the untouchable Full Throttle. Grim Fandango? Wrapped that one up a few years ago. Leisure Suit Larry? Missed that train — didn’t know the subscription code from Komsomolskaya Pravda, sadly.

But by the early 2000s, my interest in the genre waned, and I skipped most of the big names: The Longest Journey, Syberia, even Deponia — which I hadn’t even heard of until recently. Over time though, the indie scene slowly lured me back in. Thimbleweed Park, Unusual Findings, Fran Bow, Slender Threads — they reignited that spark.

So in this article, I’m diving into the games I revisited, the classics I finally conquered, and the new discoveries that surprised me. Some held up. Some... not so much. But all of them helped me see just why the genre has endured — and where it still has room to grow.
