Others think that they are destroying the original game's charm and erasing the nostalgia that many players hold dear.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the realm of gaming, a wave of nostalgia has swept across the globe, breathing new life into the pixelated legends of the 8-bit and 16-bit eras. From the iconic PC titles of the 90s to the beloved PlayStation gems of the early 2000s, these revered classics are making a triumphant comeback, adorned with the shiny badges of &amp;quot;Remaster&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Remake.&amp;quot; Fanfares blare, and the hearts of nostalgic gamers flutter with anticipation. But is this revival truly golden, or is it merely a soulless cash grab, tarnishing the legacy of these cherished titles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Resident Evil Remake" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/001_re_remake.webp" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retro game revamps come in various flavors. Sometimes, it's a mere cosmetic upgrade: a facelift for the graphics, a smoothing of the textures, and an adaptation to modern display resolutions. Think trading in those VGA visuals for crisp 4K textures, all while ensuring compatibility with modern hardware and operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/002_bg.webp" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other times, these remasters delve deeper, venturing beyond the superficial. Annoying bugs are vanquished, new levels emerge, fresh storylines unfold, and even entire gameplay mechanics get a revamp. Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition stands as a testament to this approach, where the heroes not only receive a visual overhaul but also gain additional story chapters in the form of the 'Siege of Dragonspear' campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="TMNT: Shredder's Revenge" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/003_tmnt.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there are the full-fledged sequels, the spiritual successors that carry the torch of their predecessors. TMNT: Shredder's Revenge and Streets of Rage 4 are prime examples, pixelated heirs to the beat'em'up throne, meticulously preserving the essence of the originals while infusing them with modern graphics and gameplay enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Warcraft III: Reforged" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/004_warcraft_reforged.webp" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not all remasters are created equal. Warcraft III: Reforged, the much-hyped reimagining of the iconic RTS, turned out to be a bitter disappointment for many fans. The revamped graphics, critics argued, failed to capture the soul of the original, while the gameplay changes proved questionable, rendering many beloved mods obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="BattleToads" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/005_battletoads.webp" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BattleToads suffered an even crueler fate. The remake of this once-cherished game devolved into a caricature of its former self, stripping away its unique charm and identity. Instead of the gritty pixelated brawls and the captivating antagonist, we were left with a bland, censored, and forgettable affair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="CRT filter effect" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/006_crt.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we even dare to touch these legends? After all, these games were crafted for a bygone era, designed for the warm glow of CRT monitors. Part of their allure lay in the grainy pixels, the limited color palettes, and the distinctive visual effects. Filters and upscaling techniques often fail to recapture that irreplaceable atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Archaic interfaces and direct controls in Nether Earth" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/007_nether.jpeg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the gameplay of some of these classics might feel archaic and awkward to modern gamers. Complex control schemes, unintuitive interfaces, and outdated mechanics could easily alienate the uninitiated. Yet, these very elements, along with the simplistic character and environment icons, fueled our imaginations and granted us freedom. We were the ones who filled in the blanks on the battlefield, creating our own control points, establishing our bases, and gradually turning the tide through strategy and tactics, not just micromanagement and memorized patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Another World even now looks like a piece of art - with rich story and brilliant visuals" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/008_another_world.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, games are not about esports arenas; they're about stories, about immersing ourselves in new worlds, about experiencing the thrill of the unknown, and about exercising our ingenuity and embodying the roles of our heroes. They're not about following prompts like &amp;quot;Press X to Win&amp;quot; or enduring endless cycles of repetition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Why you need to play the game, if you can just skip the level?" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/009_skip_level.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, where do we draw the line between respectful restoration and soulless mutilation? How can we breathe new life into these classics without robbing them of their essence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Broforce - a good example of modern game with retro style" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/010_broforce.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the ultimate challenge facing the enthusiasts and developers embarking on this retro revival. They must strike a delicate balance between embracing modern technology and preserving the spirit of the originals, making these cherished games accessible and appealing to the modern gamer. But perhaps the most important question is: do we even need to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="revisiting-the-classics-a-journey-through-remasters-and-remakes-of-the-80s-and-90s"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revisiting the Classics: A Journey Through Remasters and Remakes of the 80s and 90s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the whirlwind of retro gaming, remasters, and remakes that has swept the globe in recent years, it's easy to forget that these practices have been around for far longer than the last decade. Back in the 80s and 90s, when technology was evolving at breakneck speed and gaming platforms were multiplying like mushrooms after a rain shower, remasters served not only as a way to refresh beloved games but also as a means to adapt them to new computers, consoles, and operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Many games were ported to different platforms, like Pitfall" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/011_pitfall.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 80s and 90s were a period of rapid development in the gaming industry. New 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit platforms emerged, each with its own capabilities and limitations. Games created for one platform couldn't always run on others, while the power of new computers allowed for significant improvements in graphics and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Platforms changed rapidly, and games needed to be adapted" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/012_atari_ad.webp" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, the gaming industry back then was much more fragmented than it is today. PC, Amiga, Spectrum, NES, Sega, Atari – these are just a few of the platforms on which games were released. Developers didn't always have the resources to port their games to all systems, so remasters often became the only way for players on other platforms to experience these hits. Games could differ significantly from platform to platform, or even be developed by completely different companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="While we were too young to even think about gaming PCs, they were already there" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/013_gaming_pcs.webp" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a rule, porting games aimed to expand the audience from other platforms. But that wasn't all. The rapid development of technology – both hardware and software – had a significant impact, and it wasn't uncommon for games to receive remastered updates within a relatively short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pirates! -&amp;gt; Pirates! Gold (1987-1993)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="no-border centered-table italic-caption docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="50%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="50%" /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class="first last figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Pirates! (1987)" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/015_pirates_original.gif" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Pirates! (1987)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class="first last figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Pirates! Gold (1993)" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/016_pirates_gold.jpeg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Pirates! Gold (1993)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most famous examples of an early remaster. Pirates! Gold included improved graphics, new music, additional quests, and the ability to play as a female captain. Sid Meier's Pirates! was a groundbreaking game that combined elements of strategy, role-playing, and action-adventure. The 1993 remaster, Pirates! Gold, built upon the original game's success, adding new features and content while retaining the core gameplay that made it a classic. What was interesting, it was one of the unusual copy-protection methods, when you need to identify ship by its flag. The game was released on multiple platforms, including PC, Amiga, and Sega Genesis, making it accessible to a wide audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;King's Quest I (1984) -&amp;gt; King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown (1990)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="no-border centered-table italic-caption docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="50%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="50%" /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class="first last figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="King's Quest I (1984)" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/019_kings_quest_1984.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;King's Quest I (1984)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class="first last figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="King's Quest I: Quest for" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/020_kings_quest_1990.gif" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown (1990)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original King's Quest I was a groundbreaking adventure game that set the standard for the genre. Instead of many text-based adventures, it featured graphics and a point-and-click interface. Moreover this game was one of the first with mix of light action and puzzle-solving elements (with more than one solution). A revised version was released in 1990, using the SCI (Sierra Creative Interpreter) rather than the earlier AGI (Adventure Game Interpreter). The 1990 remake featured updated graphics, sound, and interface, making it more accessible to modern players. Animation became more smooth and bright, PC beeper sound was replaced with MIDI music, some text was rewritten, and some puzzles were changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Сastlevania (1986) -&amp;gt; Castlevania Chronicles (1993)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="no-border centered-table italic-caption docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="50%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="50%" /&gt;

&lt;img alt="Castlevania (1986)" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/021_castlevania_1986.gif" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Castlevania (1986)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class="first last figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Castlevania Chronicles (1993)" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/022_castlevania_1993.gif" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Castlevania Chronicles (1993)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Castlevania Chronicles was a reimagining of the original Castlevania, featuring updated graphics, sound, and gameplay. The game was released for the Sharp X68000, a Japanese computer system known for its advanced graphics and sound capabilities. Castlevania Chronicles retained the core gameplay of the original while adding new levels, enemies, and bosses. The game was later ported to the PlayStation in 2001, introducing it to a wider audience. The game was praised for its faithful adaptation of the original while adding new elements that made it feel fresh and exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Gaming platforms trend" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/023_platforms_trend.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just a few examples of the many remasters and remakes that were released in the 80s and 90s. These games not only allowed players to revisit their favorites with updated visuals and sound, but they also helped to preserve gaming history for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="We all always remember our first games and like to get back to feed our nostalgia" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/024_archive.jpeg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of remasters and remakes, there's a fine line between simply updating a game's graphics and sound and truly reimagining it for a new audience. The best remasters and remakes are those that not only look and sound great but also capture the essence of the original game while adding new elements that make them feel fresh and exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="We all love pixels - it's our life's foundation bricks" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/025_pixels.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 80s and 90s were a golden age for remasters and remakes, and many of the games released during that time are still considered classics today. These games are a testament to the enduring power of great game design, and they serve as a reminder that even the best games can be improved upon with a little love and attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="myth-history-in-making-a-pixelated-odyssey-through-time-and-myths-1989"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Myth: History in Making - A Pixelated Odyssey Through Time and Myths (1989)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging from the depths of 1989, Myth: History in Making is more than just a game; it's a pixelated odyssey through the realm of myths. Transported onto the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and Amstrad CPC, it captivated the hearts of gamers not only with its engrossing storyline but also with its unique gameplay tailored to each platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Myth: History in Making on ZX Spectrum" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/026_myth_zx.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Securing the 12th spot among the ZX Spectrum's finest titles, Myth casts you as a young archeologist swept through a temporal vortex and into the heart of &amp;quot;Time of Legends.&amp;quot; Rescued by a high priestess, you learn of the impending doom threatened by Dameron, the Dark Angel of Time. Armed with an enchanted sword, your quest is to vanquish this evil force and restore peace to the realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivid pixels come to life on the screen, painting breathtaking mystical worlds, while the haunting sounds and music create an atmosphere that sends shivers down your spine. Each level is a tapestry of running, jumping, and solving puzzles, taking you from the depths of Egyptian pyramids to the grandeur of ancient Greece. Along the way, you'll face off against skeletons, demons, and even Vikings, culminating in epic battles against mythical bosses like Medusa, Thor, and the Hydra. Unraveling the puzzles becomes a quest within a quest, as you seek the right object at the right moment to progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Myth: History in Making on Commodore 64" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/027_myth_c64.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition to the Commodore 64 brought with it a welcome boost in graphics and smoother animation, all while retaining the core gameplay elements. The atmosphere remained electrifying, thanks to the enhanced sound effects and music. The Amstrad CPC version took it a step further, injecting even more dynamism into the game world with fluid character and object movements. While the gameplay remained largely unchanged, the overall experience felt more alive and engaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Myth: History in Making on Amiga" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/028_myth_amiga.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amiga and Amiga CD32 versions ushered in a visual and auditory feast, elevating the game to new heights. The enhanced graphics and sound truly brought the world of Myth to life, while additional levels and bosses added depth and variety to the gameplay. However, a notable change came in the form of the protagonist. Replacing the young archeologist was Ankalagan, a mystical warrior from 63 AD. Wielding the power of Stonehenge, he embarks on a journey through time to combat evil forces. Upon defeating Dameron, Ankalagan returns to Stonehenge, where a sequel, &amp;quot;Dawn of Steel,&amp;quot; is teased (but sadly never materialized).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Conan: The Mysteries of Time on NES" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/029_conan_nes.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a surprising turn of events, the NES version, released in 1991 under the title Conan: The Mysteries of Time, not only changed the protagonist but also the entire setting and storyline. Gone was the archeologist's quest through time and myths; instead, Conan finds himself tasked with retrieving four urns stolen from the Crypt of Cahalla, with the promise of the throne in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Conan: The Mysteries of Time on NES" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/030_conan_nes.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most glaring difference lay not in the story but in the controls. Critics of the time lamented the awkwardness and difficulty of navigating the game, with some claiming that even with cheat codes, the first level was nearly impossible to conquer. The game was also riddled with bugs, further diminishing the overall experience. As Skyler Miller of AllGame put it, &amp;quot;Conan: The Mysteries of Time&amp;quot; stands as one of the worst NES titles ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Myth: History in Making on ZX is visual and auditory feast" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/031_myth_zx.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myth: History in Making stands as a testament to the power of storytelling and gameplay, showcasing how a simple concept could be transformed into an immersive and captivating experience. While the NES version failed to capture the essence of its predecessors, the original releases on the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, and Amiga CD32 remain cherished gems in the realm of retro gaming. These versions serve as a reminder that even in the pixelated era, games could transport players to extraordinary worlds and offer unforgettable adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="spy-hunter-a-timeless-tale-of-arcade-thrills-and-gaming-evolution"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Spy Hunter: A Timeless Tale of Arcade Thrills and Gaming Evolution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging from the neon-lit arcades of 1983, Spy Hunter was more than just a game; it was a legend in the making. With its pulse-pounding action, iconic soundtrack, and captivating premise, Spy Hunter quickly captured the hearts of gamers worldwide, embarking on an enduring journey through the ever-evolving landscape of video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Spy Hunter on arcade" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/032_spy_hunter_arcade.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the arcade original, you stepped into the shoes of Agent Alex Hunter (inspired by Bond, James Bond), a skilled operative tasked with dismantling the nefarious Spy Organization. Behind the wheel of your trusty G-Wagen, you navigated treacherous roads, weaving through traffic and dodging enemy vehicles. Your arsenal included an array of weaponry, from trusty machine guns to rocket launchers and deployable oil slicks, all designed to thwart your adversaries. As you progressed through the levels, you not only faced off against hordes of enemy cars but also solved puzzles and collected bonuses, each step bringing you closer to foiling the Spy Organization's wicked schemes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Spy Hunter on Atari 7800" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/033_spy_hunter_7800.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arcade's success spawned a wave of ports for home consoles, each bringing Spy Hunter's thrilling chase to a new generation of gamers. Atari 7800 and ColecoVision (1984) were among the first to host the iconic game, capturing the essence of the arcade experience while featuring slightly simplified graphics and sound. Atari 7800's controls deviated somewhat from the original, while ColecoVision offered a more responsive experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Spy Hunter on Commodore 64" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/034_spy_hunter_c64.jpeg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodore 64 (1985) received one of the most celebrated ports, lauded for its enhanced graphics, catchy sound, and keyboard-optimized controls. For many Commodore 64 enthusiasts, this version became the definitive Spy Hunter experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Spy Hunter on ZX Spectrum" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/035_spy_hunter_zx.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZX Spectrum (1985) presented a unique challenge for fans. The limitations of the ZX Spectrum's hardware meant that the game's graphics and sound were less impressive, and the controls required some adaptation. However, for those willing to persevere, the thrill of the chase remained intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Spy Hunter on NES" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/036_spy_hunter_nes.jpeg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NES (1986) delivered the most widely played port of Spy Hunter. The NES's affordability and widespread popularity made it a gateway for countless gamers to experience the adrenaline rush of Spy Hunter. While the graphics, music, and gameplay were simplified compared to the computer versions, the dynamic action and NES-friendly controls more than compensated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Spy Hunter cover on ZX Spectrum" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/037_spy_hunter_zx_cover.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spy Hunter saga didn't end with the arcade and home console ports. The series continued to evolve with a string of sequels and reimaginings, each offering a unique take on the core gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Spy Hunter II on arcade" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/038_spy_hunter_2_arcade.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spy Hunter II (1987) marked a significant turning point for the series, introducing a third-person perspective that would become a hallmark of future installments. The game's release on arcades paved the way for its eventual transition to PlayStation, where it embraced 3D graphics while retaining its high-octane action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Spy Hunter on PlayStation 2" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/039_spy_hunter_2001.jpeg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, a revitalized Spy Hunter (essentially the second arcade installment) made its way to PC, PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox. This revival was followed by a numbered sequel for PlayStation 2 and Xbox – Spy Hunter 2 – and later, Spy Hunter: Nowhere To Run, inspired by the film of the same name and incorporating third-person action into the gameplay. However, these sequels failed to capture the widespread popularity of the earlier titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Super Spy Hunter on NES" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/040_super_spy_hunter.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A notable exception was Super Spy Hunter (1992) for NES, which served as a sequel (or perhaps a remake) with enhanced graphics and new bosses. The gameplay was more dynamic and varied, with branching paths and significant bonuses, giving the game a fresh lease on life. And let's not forget the soundtrack – it was simply unforgettable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Super Spy Hunter on NES gameplay" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/041_super_spy_hunter.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout its evolution, Spy Hunter has remained a testament to the enduring power of well-crafted gameplay. From its humble arcade origins to its home console ports and subsequent sequels, Spy Hunter has captivated gamers across generations, proving that the thrill of the chase and the satisfaction of outsmarting your foes never go out of style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Spy Hunter cover on NES" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/042_spy_hunter_cover.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're reminiscing about your childhood adventures on the Atari 7800 or discovering the game's timeless appeal on modern platforms, Spy Hunter stands as a reminder that the best games are those that transcend time and technology, capturing the essence of fun and excitement that continues to resonate with players worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="old-remakes-and-ports-are-good-or-not"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Old remakes and ports are good... or not?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a conclusion of diving into retro-remakes, I have to say that main reason was intensive evolution of gaming platforms and technologies. The games were ported to different platforms, and the remakes were made to adapt the games to new hardware and software. The remakes were made to expand the audience and to preserve the gaming history. The remakes were made to improve the graphics and sound, to add new elements, and to make the games feel fresh and exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Old games was not so good as we remember, and many never been and will be remade" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/043_games_80s.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sure, remakes, like Conan, wasn't always good, but in average, each new version of games was the way to make game better and extend developers' ideas. To get rid off platform limitations because of performance, graphics, music and size of the games. The remakes were made to make the games more immersive and captivating. The remakes were made to make the games more unforgettable and enjoyable. So, it was a time of win-win situation for both developers and gamers. In other words, developers makes more money and makes their ideas easier to develop and share with gamers, and gamers get more enjoyable and unforgettable experience. And make more and more experiments on further games...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial - the game that crashed the gaming industry" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/044_atari_crash_et.webp" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, for sure, lead to second investment wave after Atari's video games crash in 1983. More and more investors come to the gaming industry, and the gaming industry started to grow rapidly. But, in other hand, it lead to following crashes because of further failed too ambitious projects, what leads to situation, when driver of development starts to changing from developers to investors. And, for sure, remakes begin to be more and more soulless cash grabs, than pixelated renaissance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="back-to-the-reality-we-deserve-do-we-need-remakes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Back to the reality we deserve: do we need remakes?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the 80s and 90s, when remasters and remakes were a necessity, today's gaming landscape is vastly different. The rise of digital distribution platforms like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gog.com/"&gt;GOG&lt;/a&gt; and the wealth of information available on sites like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.mobygames.com/"&gt;MobyGames&lt;/a&gt; have made it easier than ever for gamers to access and enjoy classic titles. The question then arises: do we really need remakes and remasters of retro games?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="If you can play new games, why you need to play old ones?" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/045_new_games.jpeg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point here, that games, like any other art, are a product of their time. They reflect the technology, culture, and design philosophies of the era in which they were created. Attempting to modernize these games risks erasing the very elements that made them special in the first place. The grainy pixels, the limited color palettes, the distinctive visual effects – these are not just technical limitations; they are part of the game's identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Not all games acceptable and playable now, like Raid Over Moscow, but they are iconic of their time" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/046_raid_over_moscow.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sure, you can always get on retrogrades point of view and say, that you need to play only originals, on original hardware, with original controllers, and original CRT monitors. It maybe a bit expensive, old hardware will grab your space, and you will need to spend a lot of time to find and repair all the stuff, how to setup games even on emulators, even on simplified DosBox or ScummVM. Does it worth it? It looks like an art, that you need to see only in the museum, you need to travel to see Mona Lisa on Louvre, you need to go to the Hermitage to see the Rembrandt's paintings. But, in other hand, you can always buy a print, or a poster, or a postcard, or a magnet, or a t-shirt with the same picture, and you can always see it on the internet. And, for sure, you can always play a remake or a remaster of the game, and you can always watch a let's play on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="DosBox - the best way to play old games on modern hardware" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/047_dosbox.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will it be different experience? For sure. Will it worth it? It depends on you. In general, digital platforms, like emulators, or just a GOG adaptations are quite simple and provides the same old games with minimal changes. Just say, you pay only service fee, and you get the game, that you can play on your modern hardware, with modern controllers, on your modern display. And, for sure, you can always play the original, if you want to. But, in other hand, remakes and remasters are more expensive, and they are more different from the original. They are more modern, they are more adapted to modern gamers, they are more adapted to modern hardware, they are more adapted to modern controllers, they are more adapted to modern displays. And, for sure, they are more adapted to modern gaming industry, with all its pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="GOG - the best way to play old games on modern hardware" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/048_gog_setup.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But... why do we need it? Should we pay for non-original, copy or some 'inspired' art?..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pure-remasters-why-not"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pure remasters - why not?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's set up some terminology first. Remasters are the games, that are just adapted to modern hardware and software. Usually it's latest version of game with all of bugfixes, if applicable, most popular, non-gameplay changing mods, and with some compatibility and graphic fixes (texture upscaling, support of modern resolutions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Kane - the main character of Command &amp;amp; Conquer series" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/049_cnc_kane.jpeg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, it's the thing when you don't want to have a troubles and spend too much time for setup the game andor want to play on higher resolutionsstream mode. So, you paying money for your time (yeah-yeah, even upscaling may be done by yourself, but it's not so easy, and it's not so fast).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="no-border centered-table italic-caption docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="50%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="50%" /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class="first last figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Command &amp;amp; Conquer: Tiberian Dawn (1995)" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/051_cnc_original.gif" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Command &amp;amp; Conquer: Tiberian Dawn (1995)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class="first last figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Command &amp;amp; Conquer Remastered Collection (2020)" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/051_cnc_remaster.gif" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Command &amp;amp; Conquer Remastered Collection (2020)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As good example of pure remaster is Command &amp;amp; Conquer Remastered Collection. It's just a good old C&amp;amp;C and Red Alert with all of the patches, with all of the mods, with all of the upscaling, with all of the compatibility fixes, with all of the modern resolutions support. And it's just a good old C&amp;amp;C and Red Alert, nothing more, nothing less. Updated, actually, re-drawn graphics, rewritten, more modern sound by Frank Klepacki and new network code - that's all need to get maximum from the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="KKND - Krush, Kill 'n' Destroy" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/052_kknd.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, but it's for me, who loved this series. It wasn't the problem to run C&amp;amp;C:Gold on modern PC, but other games, like Wages of War or KKND were pure nightmare to setup on modern hardware. I spent a lot of time to setup them, but played just few hours. Because I was disappointed with graphics, audio and gameplay. Disappointed in my nostalgig feelings and memories. May I say it's archaic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Total Annihilation - the game that has a best physics effects in RTS" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/053_total_annahilation.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you thing further and imagine some newcomer gamer playing C&amp;amp;C... Maybe he will be disappointed too? Maybe he will not understand, why this game is so popular? Why this remaster is needed? Because art will work only in time, when it was created? Because it's not so good as modern games? Because it's not so good as modern RTS games? So, what is modern RTS games?.. Gaming industry is evolving, actually regressing to simplicity. You may complain about unbalanced C&amp;amp;C, or too slow gamplay, instead of &amp;quot;point control&amp;quot; strategies, like were introduced by Hearts of Iron or early Dawn of War games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Dawn of War - very first game was very good and detailed, and not overwhelmed with micromanagement" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/050_dawn_of_war.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's not completely true... What is point of control? What is micromanagement? Excluding some parts from gameplay will add something (like dynamics), but will ruin the rest, like tactics or strategy vision. Because, let's get C&amp;amp;C itself, or better example, like Total Annahilation or successor - Supreme Commander, where you always need to &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; real points, choosed by yourself and your opponents, like in real war: tight terrain passes, resources, frequently points, depend on different battle and weather situations. So, it makes game more dynamic, and more creative, because you use not pre-difined patterns, but your own imagination, creativity and problem-solving skills. And, for sure, it's more interesting, than just &amp;quot;press X to win&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Supreme Commander - seems like the best RTS game ever" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/054_supreme_commander.jpeg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, crystallized puzzles, just in C&amp;amp;C levels, or even on Dune 2 with control limitations makes game more challenging. Terrain, map, object itsels becomes not just a resources, but your dynamic environment, because in original games you need to take in account gravity and weather, terrain, like in Tiberium Sun voxel terrain (and it's possible to change it), or Total Annahilation / Supreme Commander wind, fire, solar radiation conditions as well as debris and wreckage. In games, like &amp;quot;Behind enemy lines&amp;quot; you also need to use terrain, even some holes in brick wall to hit your opponent, or raze and change landscape instead of just control something. Instead of battle arena, sportish-style, balanced games, where there is no place for creativity, just another way to make it &amp;quot;cybersportish&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;esporthish&amp;quot;. What for?.. To make more patternish and skillish instead of creative and variety, even when variety is not optimal and winning... Why we are playing games? For fun, for something new, unusual. Or just to win? Why not to press &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Red Faction - the game with destructable environment, probably the best in FPS genre" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/055_red_faction.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sure, I understand, that simplification and balance is crucial for multiplayer games, and give possibility to change landscape, like in Red Faction game for multiplayer will be bad idea, because requires too much time for balancing. And after huge amount of time FPS gamers get finally in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 a bit of destructable environment, and maybe some time will get physics with objects like it was in Half-Life 2. So... limitations, regression and simplifications have a place, for sure, but it's a question of freedom and possibilities. Should you exchange your freedom for balance and simplification? Should you exchange your creativity for patterns and skill? Repeat, repeat, remake, remaster instead of making something new?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="things-getting-worse-when-you-adapting-old-games-for-new-gamers"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Things getting worse, when you adapting old games for new gamers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, ok, time is changes. I need to get it and not to complain like old man. Nothing is better even to rework games much more, even redraw, change gameplay, just to tell you story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Unusual Findings - inspired by old point-and-click adventures" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/057_unusual_findings.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually I'm very excited of remakes of classical point-and-click adventures. Yeah, remakes of Monkey Island is great. Games loose their pixelated charm, but they become more understandable, more playable, more enjoyable even for me. And, for sure, they are more beautiful. But, for sure, they are not the same. Game loses &amp;quot;word control&amp;quot; style, became more modern. And, even you have an option to switch to old-style graphics and gameplay you must probably won't do it. It's a good example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Monkey Island - one of the best point-and-click adventure remasters" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/056_monkey_island.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may not agree with me and say like that changes too radical, and that's why for you, old boy, was released Thimbleweed Park or Unusual findings. For sure, most probably, point-and-click games, as well as classic RTS games is not popular and outdated, like paintings of Boticelli not so modern like installation of Maurizio Cattelan. But key point is here that story, vibe and gameplay experience wasn't changed. You may play more comfortable, but you still have the same feelings, which some time may replace your memories and emotions. Occasionally you'll begin to think that game always been like than, and will be very surprised when switch back to original. That's good sign, like good restoration of old painting, when you can't say what is original and what is restored - with brighter colors. And not brighter than original, but brighter than it was faded with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Pirate song from Monkey Island never been so good" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/058_monkey_island.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to make changes to get better. So, do you remember Super Spy Hunter? Yeah, here it is again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Baldur's Gate 3 - the game that was made with respect to original narrative, gameplay, visuals and atmosphere" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/059_baldurs_gate.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, balance and adaptation for new times is needed if you expecting to expand and extend, even when you use old-fashioned gameplay, like dungeon crawlers, like RPGs like Baldur's Gate (and BG3 is great example!). Addition of content to Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition is great example of how to make game better, and not just upscaling, not just extending (wow, even huge chapter, looks like whole game - Siege of Dragonspear), but also rewrite, extend and update dialogues and consequences, make it looks like modern and trendy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Baldur's Gate - the game that was made with respect to original narrative, gameplay, visuals and atmosphere" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/060_gabriel_knight.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you know, even just good remaster maybe very can be very controversial... especially when changed something very controversial. Let's take as example Gabriel Knight 20th Anniversary Edition. It's just a good old Gabriel Knight - with same story, with updated graphics (yeah, it's not a cozy pixel-art, but I liked it as for Monkey Island), with updated sound, with updated controls. But... But when game (or art) changes, it should follow the same rules, setting, characters, same atmosphere. Scenes becomes brighter, what is not good for detective and mystical plot. Moreover, I was disappointed by comparing original dialogues and new ones. For sure, in modern world some terms and thoughts of characters may be controversial or even offensive for modern ear, but it's a specific hero, character. When you describe English Queen from 17th century, she can't be another person, with another ethnicity, race or even gender, as fairy tale, as any piece of art. You can't just replace Tom Sawyer with Germiona Granger, or make a black Sherlock Holmes. It's not a question of racism, sexism or any other -ism, it's a question of art, of history, of culture, just because it's character, for specific time, with some thoughts and style. You can't just change it, because it's not yours. You can't just change it, because it's not modern. You can't just change it, because it's not politically correct. Why you doing it? And if you do so, just made something by yourself first!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rewriting-the-history-we-can-do-it-better"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rewriting the history - we can do it better!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, remakes and remasters are good, but they should be made with respect to original. They should be made with respect to history, to culture, to art. They should be made with respect to gamers, to developers, to investors. They should be made with respect to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Todd Howard sales same shit for 20 years" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/061_todd_howard.jpeg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collecting the gold is good reason, but just remember collapses of industry. If you made something, make it with quality, and not just brewing some &amp;quot;marketing research&amp;quot; formulas, but with your heart, jsut an artist, what to share the vision, idea, story. That's why indie games becomes more and more interesting and sometimes more profitable and famous than AAA titles. Because they are made with love, with respect, with creativity, with freedom, something out of the box...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Mind-blowing Undertale game made a storm in indie scene" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/063_undertale.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as good examples I may say, that not only remasters may be good way to update to new technology stack and introduce art for further gamers. Remasters, what means that not only graphics, but moreover, gameplay and story was changed, may be good way to make game better, more interesting, more enjoyable. And, for sure, it's not so easy to make it, because you need to keep the balance, you need to keep the spirit, you need to keep the atmosphere, or change it in better way, to get new feelings from familiar things, from original story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Creepy and tolerant soulless characters becomes more and more frequent" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/065_re_remake.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I'm not a fan of such approach, because, usually, it leads to call you to pass the game once more, but with some new - new chapter, content and graphics, or some innovations in gameplay. It's fine, for sure, but to get new emotions from old game you may pass it not using right hand, but left one, or playing it upside down using graphic filters and broadcasting it at the same time. No, not at all, for sure, but... I always asking myself - why I need to pay developer for this? Why they spend their lifes to update it in such way, but didn't do something new, with much more possibilities and creativity, if they able to do good games? Why humankind spend thier resourse just for remakes, which is too much similar, but not exact copies, as remasters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Mafia looks visually stunning, with solid gameplay, but music and atmosphere a bit lost" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/064_mafia.webp" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, simple answer is here - money, and engagement of new auditory. Mafia remake, Resident Evil or Last Of Us, part 1, or Dead Space, Final Fantasy are good examples, they are remakes, not just a remastered versions. I think with higher probability I will play them if it was my first try, and I haven't tried originals. It looks similar to good remakes of movies. Like it was Godzilla, Stepford's Wifes, Karate Kid, Wicker Park, Scent of Woman and so on. And, for sure, as for movies there are bad remakes, like GhostBusters, then bad remakes also exists for games, like BattleToads, Warcraft III: Reforged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-remakes"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Remakes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't say anything that shitty crap about Battletoads remake. Original game is fun, but one of the most difficult games on NES, Genesis. It's still playable instead of Ghost and Goblings (no-no, let's not talk about hardcore games). Because of too high difficulty of Battletoads, it's pain in ass. It's not a simple art, it's nice to look somebody else gaming. Or just spend few tries on turbo-tunnel while home party. But better in single-mode. Because you will hate your teammate. And... I don't know how it was possible to made such hardcore game, with brutal and testerone toads, mature comix style, with sexy Dark Queen protaginist, how it possible to make so childish and messy?..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Battletoads actually not a bad game, but it's completely with other mood, characters and style. Actually it's completely different game and universe" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/066_battletoads.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many, many remakes nothing just money-making objects, it may be not always bad, but as some any other projects and sequels it may fail and ruin franchise. And that's the most painful while somebody making remakes or sequels - risk to ruin good memories. And, when it will be needed, updated versions of it - because of legals and ruined expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Sequels a kinda similar to remakes, but sometimes it's even worse" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/062_andromeda.jpeg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, my main complain about remasters and remakes that personally I expect from them progress, improvement, but not the changing what already works well. Moreover, for remakes and sequels one of the most important things that developers have something to bring and say new, but in plot and canvas of original games, never ruin or nullify previous games. This means, that every next part should be better, more complex, but more playable and accessible to wider range of audience, not because of simplifications, but because of ports and technologies updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Fallout 2 - it's story-rich isometric RPG&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Fallout 3" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/067_fallout_3.jpeg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Fallout 3 is 3D shooter with RPG elements and questless open world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why original fans of Fallout hates Fallout 3 and each and every games of Todd Hovard, because key element, gameplay and universe was changed, genre and canvas. I may say that Fallout is not a bad game, but, hey, that's not the same game, it something different. It's not a tons of dialogues, role-playing dive into character's skins, just not bad looking, but average shooter in inspired by Fallout series decorations. And, for sure,even though I despise the empty and copy-paste approach of Betheda's TES/Fallout, it might be nice games, if they not exploit original series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="One of the bes Lara Croft's remakes - Tomb Raider (2013)" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/069_tomb_raider_2013.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may say, that not a remaster, not a slightly game, but a good alternative was Tomb Raider (2013), which makes Lara looks like more humane and much realistic, but didn't cancel her sexuality or violence scenes within game. In fact, it wasn't a reboot, wasn't a sequel at all, it was just a new story for familiar character, much more with accent to survival atmosphere. And it was good, because it was new, it was interesting, it was exciting. And it was a good game, not just a good remake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Final Fantasy 7 - the game that was made with respect to original narrative, gameplay, visuals and atmosphere" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/070_final_fantasy7.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, love to details, passion to bring new, but not to change existing always worked. Always, even for original sequels, not just for fading series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Spyro: Reignited Trilogy - one of my favourite remakes. Love it!" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/071_spyro.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step-by-step improvement of games is a key, balancing between needs of gamers and will to surprise them. And it's hard job, actually. That's what separates good games from bad ones. Let's get back to the roots, to the original, to the art, to the passion, to the creativity, to the freedom, to the fun. And let's make games great again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="TMNT: Shredder's Revenge - I still feel hungry for pizza while playing this game" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/072_tmntsr.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as one of the best examples of remaster / sequels style was Spyro: Reignited Trilogy (actually we replay this game with my wife each Christmas), DuckTales: Remastered, TMNT: Sredder's Revenge and, for sure, Streets of Rage 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Streets of Rage 4 - I love it even I never played original games" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/073_sor_4.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last is the best example, how game progressed. I never played this game just a kid, just tried it couple of times in 90's friend's Sega Megadrive 2. It's bright, challenging and famous series, actually, started for me from fourth part. Yeah-yeah, shame on me...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Streets of Rage - I'm suffering while playing this game, but I like it" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/074_sor_1.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this is good game, with great coop walkthrough possibilities. I liked it and was inspired to try and pass first three games. And it was interesting experiment to look how game progressed, how it was changed, how it was improved. Without blinding sense of nostalgia feelings. Even for me in 2024 it was tough to play first part, because of limited possibilities of characters (where's all this combos of fourth part?), but, what was most important, I hate controls and  feeling of what is happening is like in oil, too constrained, with poor possibility to position and calculate line of depth characters and enemies. But I liked this game, because of variety of enemies and bossed, different tactics, and understanding that all of them I've seen in fourth sequel. And, for sure, as any of early arcade games it was too hard, too challenging, that I needed to spend a lot of time and tries to pass it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Streets of Rage 2 - I like it, but it's too easy. Blaze in mini-skirt and white lingerie in my heart forever" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/075_sor_2.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, second part was much faster, easier and with improved graphics. Dynamics, controls was improved, visual style is great, but after challenging first part it was too easy. And, for sure, it was too short. And that's was also unusual for me, because game balanced at the edge - it becomes better in some aspects, but without setting to hard difficulty it looked less interesting in some aspects. Well, in total it was the same, very good game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Streets of Rage 3 - Perfect challenge, perfect game, mind-blowing story and endings" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/076_sor_3.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, third part, is the best, because it compiles best parts from first two parts, and enrich it with new features, combos, characters, craziness and, especially, story and several endings. Wow, it was just amazing game, which forced me to replay it several times, not only in order to learn the behavior of various enemies and bosses, but also to appreciate the different endings and even locations in the game. Brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Streets of Rage 4 - you may play it as you want and extend experience with new features and modes" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/077_sor_4_blaze.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, at last, fourth part, Streets of Rage 4, just adding and extending, nothing to removing from originals: same enemies, but a bunch of new, same combos, but a bunch of new, and, actually, totally new fighting system, whiuch you can use, or ignore and use original, or mix them. Wow, you have an options to tune game for you, adjust complexity, and re-play it several ties, because there's a great achievement and unlockingupgrading system in the game. And, it's fun, in the same style, but not the same graphics. You have to try it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="let-s-make-games-great-again"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let's make games great again!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, good remake is the game, which extends game with something new, and not just a graphics, makes game more accessable, improving controls and response, but not just a simplification, and, for sure, not just a copy-paste. Good remake is the game, which allows you to play the same game in the same way you played original, like remakes of Monkey Island, with reasonable question - why you should do it, if newer is better? Good remake or sequel is the game, that allows you to compile, mix and tune game using better for you from original and sibling game. Good remake is the game, that allows you to play the game, which you never played, but you always wanted to play, like remakes of Tomb Raider or Spyro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Contra: Operation Galuga yet another sequel, totally in canvas of original game" src="/assets/images/articles/gaming/retro_remakes/078_contra.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is my answer to the question, do we need remakes? Yes, we need remakes, but not just a remakes, but good remakes, which makes games great again! I expect remaster to be much cheaper as entry point to game for new systems, without any gameplay changes. And remasters, if it's really needed, should extend, not simplify the game, and should give options to choose your favourite style to play. And, if you making sequels, that's hardest - you should do the both - update and extend, but not to loose vibe, setting, gameplay and story of original. If not - just create your own title, use programming principle - DRY - do not repeat yourself. So, what do you think about it? Do you agreed with me, or you have some other opinion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Let's remember best chilling PC games of 90s. If you like horror games, you should definitely check out these classics!&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Autumn is a time when spirits roam the earth and nightmares become reality. Days get shorter, and more and more darkness creeps into the house. For me, growing up in the 90s, these dark autumn evenings were always a time when I could immerse myself in the world of horror. I would just be getting ready for school, or it would seem like I had just had a lesson, or I would be going home, and only have to do homework - and it would be dark outside already. And it becomes scary that the night is approaching, and you still have to sit and toil over your homework. But if you did it, if you had dinner, then you could turn on the “Record-VC381D”, press the panel, twist the knobs to catch the cable better, and...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my childhood, I watched horror movies from the 80s on cable. They scared the hell out of me, but I couldn't tear myself away from them. Mom told me to turn away from the wall and go to sleep, but I still peeked and absorbed with my eyes the severed heads and fountains of blood that Jason or Freddy would arrange. And then I was afraid of everything: the creak of the parquet, my reflection in the mirror, that someone would come out of the corner if, God forbid, I had to go to the bathroom...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="That very Record-381D and that very Freddy" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/bca/4e3/3dd/bca4e33dd3b7560ba8adc64dcc805daf.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer, on the other hand, was something bright, colorful, and light, like Disney. I launched The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.old-games.ru/game/101.html"&gt;The Lost Vikings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.old-games.ru/game/1138.html"&gt;Jazz Jackrabbit&lt;/a&gt;, watched my father play &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.old-games.ru/game/718.html"&gt;Police Quest&lt;/a&gt;. How he brought in paper bags of 5.25” floppy disks and copied something new to the computer. “What is this, is this a game?” - “No, these are programs” - “And the games? Will you bring the games?” And of course, my father brought them. Once I accidentally launched a new game from the blue, lined screen of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.abandonwaredos.com/abandonware-game.php?abandonware=Norton+Commander+5.5&amp;amp;gid=1814"&gt;Norton Commander&lt;/a&gt;. The game turned out to be scary, and I immediately turned off the computer as soon as some creature flew into my room and started biting me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But curiosity prevailed, and I decided to find out what else was there, what was this &amp;quot;scary&amp;quot;. So I discovered the world of computer horrors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Jazz never seemed like a good character to me" src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/getpro/habr/upload_files/3a9/6b1/9ea/3a96b19ea0d6f9b346f74b16e4581aa9.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will tell you about 31 scary PC games from the 90s that left terrible scars of delight and nightmare on my soul. These are the games that made me shudder with fear and glued me to the screen for hours on end. Of course, I didn't play them all (and couldn't, because of the language barrier and the lack of them on my floppy disks and discs), I met half of them much later, but still, the horrors of those times are not just titles - it's that familiar feeling that was in the warm &amp;quot;then&amp;quot; of childhood. I want you to feel the same excitement and awe that I felt playing these games. So close all the doors and windows, turn off the lights, put on headphones, and immerse yourself in the world of horror and nightmares on this night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="alone-in-the-dark-1992"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Alone in the Dark (1992)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autumn 1994. I walk into my father's room and sit down at the computer, turning on the large button on the monitor, then on the system unit, waiting for the number 40 to appear, and pressing TURBO. Finally, I turn on the &amp;quot;monitor ears&amp;quot; - Genius speakers attached to the monitor with a silver mouse. The red light comes on and a barely audible warm rustle breaks out. On the table is a plastic box containing five 5.25&amp;quot; floppy disks with this... creepy game... well, and a couple of other disks from my father. But you don't need to copy anything anymore - the game is already on the computer. Just go to NC and press enter on ALONE.EXE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Hello, Norton Commander!" src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/getpro/habr/upload_files/2b6/5db/4c5/2b65db4c5e92b9bc6f95af9582b22580.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew it would be scary, but I didn't know how much. Although I had already launched the game several times, I... found myself in an abandoned mansion. I was in a completely unfamiliar world, and I didn't know what to expect. The mansion was dark and gloomy. I could hear strange noises, and it seemed to me that someone was following me. The warm crackling of the speakers was filled with more and more terrifying sounds of an invisible presence. And when I started exploring the mansion, barely managing to get out of the first room, I discovered that it was full of ghosts and monsters. I was scared to death, but I was determined to unravel the mystery of the mansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Monsters are tough, and the weapon is of course" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/273/fdb/37b/273fdb37bb4b6c12d4afeb16b4536332.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was very atmospheric. The gloomy graphics and terrifying sounds created a sense of real horror. After the dynamic arcades, this game was sluggish and sticky, my 386, it seems, the game was a little harder, which also added to the fear. But the most important thing is this striking difference from all other games - it seemed to come out of virtual reality. Here everything was voluminous, real 3D graphics, like in &amp;quot;Lawnmower Man&amp;quot;, and the same insane atmosphere. What to do? How? Fight, come on, be quicker!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gameplay was pretty simple. I could explore the mansion, solve puzzles, and fight monsters. Very slowly, inefficiently. The game was not easy. I often died from monsters or traps. But I didn't give up. I was determined to unravel the mystery of the mansion. I couldn't get far in the game, but I read the walkthrough in the &amp;quot;Encyclopedia of IBM PC Computer Games&amp;quot;, read it and imagined what else was creepy going on there, worms? What? And what does it look like, I tried, I tried to pass and could not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="These worms became a symbol of a dead end" src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/getpro/habr/upload_files/6e3/a1e/a92/6e3a1ea92cd7512e4552ca41b6fb7f9f.jpeg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game features many monsters (most of which I didn't see in my childhood (maybe fortunately)), inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft. For example, in the basement of the mansion there are monsters that look like fishmen, and in the library you can meet a monster with huge claws. Alone in the Dark was the first game in the survival horror genre, and it had a major impact on the development of this genre. In Resident Evil or Silent Hill, released much later, it is easy to recognize these very strange camera angles, a certain clumsiness and vulnerability of the characters, which became the basis of the genre. However, if Alone in The Dark is one of the first attempts to create a polished three-dimensional horror world, albeit with pre-rendered locations, but not the only one that formed the basis of future famous horror games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, Alone in the Dark was the first computer horror game, but chronologically, of course, it is not the first graphical, let alone the first text horror story on PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="maniac-mansion-1987"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Maniac Mansion (1987)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sit on the unfolded sofa and play with plastic animals, giving them orders to ride on this strange iron machine. I sit behind my father, who is playing something. Being the ruler of animals is of course interesting, but it is much more interesting to look over my father's shoulder. On the computer screen was an abandoned mansion. I watched my father control a character wandering around the house. The mansion was dark and gloomy. Strange creatures inhabited it, making terrifying sounds. My father often died, and I saw him die at the hands of monsters or traps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Death and fun" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/519/46c/eb7/51946ceb7383884a7e2c8788fb43ba7d.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't play Maniac Mansion myself, but even watching the game was a bit creepy. Maybe I didn't play it back then because I didn't have a walkthrough and I didn't understand the English text. Maniac Mansion is a visual adventure game in which the player must select word commands to control the character. The game is divided into several rooms, each with various items and characters. The player must use items and interact with characters to progress through the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was quite difficult for its time. Players had to be very careful not to die at the hands of monsters or traps. This is quite unusual for the genre. If Sierra games have the ability to die, then in Maniac Mansion from Lucas Art, in whose games everything is quite safe, the first game is the height of bloodthirstiness and a test of ingenuity and reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Maniac Mansion is a record holder for references to it in other quests in new games such as Thimbleweed Park or Unusual Findings" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/f56/828/e49/f56828e49f8f1f63bd25c4d5ad8e5d4a.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game's plot takes place in the abandoned mansion of Professor Flint, who kidnapped a girl named Daisy. Five friends, David, Sue, Eddy, Jackie, and Roy, team up to save her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The player must explore the mansion to find Daisy and defeat Professor Flint and prevent the world from being taken over by an evil genius. Along the way, the player will face many dangers, including monsters, traps, and puzzles. The player must choose one of five characters to complete the game. Each character has their own unique abilities that can help in completing the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="I don't know where the lab is" src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/getpro/habr/upload_files/37c/e2a/652/37ce2a6524ef632bb0c216cc08c86d31.jpeg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most iconic features of the game is its humor. The game is full of black humor and parodies of popular films and works of literature. In fact, this character will be transferred to all subsequent Lucas Arts games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another iconic feature of the game is its atmosphere. The game is very atmospheric and scary, especially for its time. It is inspired by the works of Edgar Allan Poe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1993, a sequel to the game was released called Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle. In this game, players control three characters who must prevent the spread of green slime that turns people into mutants. The game was also very atmospheric and scary, and it was well-received by critics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Technology has moved on" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/962/d4a/e70/962d4ae705136e5acc726e1fe671fcba.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, a remake of the game was released called Maniac Mansion: The Mansion of Madness. This remake updated the graphics and sound, and also added new elements, such as new puzzles and secrets. The remake was also well-received by critics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the cult status of Maniac Mansion and the maximum brutality and cruelty of the gameplay (oh yes, games of the 90s were brutal and cruel - and rivers of blood in Mortal Kombat, and dismemberment in Prince of Persia), nevertheless, as my father abandoned the game, not having completed it to the end, so my imagination was captured not by it, but by another series in which my father played, namely…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics' average rating: 85.2%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="laura-bow-1989"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Laura Bow (1989)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Laura Bow series of classic adventure games began in 1989 with the release of the game &amp;quot;The Colonel's Bequest&amp;quot;. It was one of the first games in the genre of detective adventure with elements of mystery and horror. The action takes place in the 1920s in an old mansion of Colonel Dijon. The player must investigate a series of mysterious murders of guests of the mansion. The atmosphere of the game perfectly conveys the gloomy spirit of an old mansion with ghosts and secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The artists paid attention to details with love" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/38b/25e/837/38b25e837cb691e9995eb1a47ba8428f.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second game in the series, &amp;quot;The Dagger of Amon Ra&amp;quot;, was released in 1992. Laura Bow is now in the role of a young museum employee in New York in the 1920s. She must unravel the theft of a valuable artifact from the museum's collection. The gameplay has become more diverse, with more characters to interact with. However, the dark atmosphere of a detective with elements of mystery is fully preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura Bow is still not a horror game, but the mysterious atmosphere, the anxiety of touching some ancient secret, was quite winning for me over the atmosphere of a rather absurd B-movie style, in the same Maniac Mansion. The game was more serious, and therefore I believed in what was happening much more. It is difficult to say what my father's opinion was, but perhaps, after Police Quests, it was one of those rare games that he thoughtfully and for a long time sat until the victorious end. I can't say where he got the guide (I don't remember that I met it anywhere in the books later), I don't remember how the plot looked to me then, because everything was in English, but my father, seeing my interest, explained something along the way - very fragmentary; and turning off the computer, he always summarized the events, what conclusions he made and where he was going to go. And it was all the more offensive to me that I missed the ending of the story, and asked my father to replay, but the story was over...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The strong point of the game is the atmosphere of the era" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/8a5/3d6/da9/8a53d6da9b26d4995a99e18f3860b18c.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both games are remembered to me by interesting characters, an exciting plot with unexpected twists, and challenging puzzles. The investigation has reached a dead end? You'll have to search all the locations again for clues! It's really exciting and doesn't let go of the screen until the very denouement. The atmosphere of old mansions and museums is conveyed very authentically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Laura Bow is more mystery, quest, rather than a full-fledged horror, but unlike Maniac Mansion, it still radiates an alarming atmosphere and plays nicely without the need to launch a remake. Laura Bow is a true classic of the adventure genre, and it stands apart from the style inherent in Sierra quests, everything, to my taste, is more logical and fits into the detective plot. Anyone who loves dark detective stories with ghosts will appreciate these games!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/462/the-dagger-of-amon-ra/"&gt;Laura Bow on MobyGames&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics' average rating: 83.7%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="elvira-mistress-of-the-dark-1990"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Elvira: Mistress of the Dark (1990)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elvira: Mistress of the Dark is a 1991 graphic adventure game with elements of horror and mystery. The main character, Elvira, arrives at her old castle, and then creepy things start to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Elvira is a witch, but she's not evil" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/bce/754/d8f/bce754d8f885c7b8280822e5befcf34d.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game belongs to the category of those that my father played, but they were unplayable. On the one hand, thanks to pirates, and on the other hand, because of pirates. The game versions were mercilessly cut, and made the game unplayable. Since it was the early nineties, games were copied from floppy disk to floppy disk, packed with arj and cut with long. I can't say that the game is very big - the full version is only 2.6 megabytes, but firstly, 3.5&amp;quot; floppy disks were just starting to appear, and on 5.25&amp;quot; floppy disks the game took up as many as 8 disks! Later, there will be one more version on two 3.5&amp;quot; disks (1.9MB), and it will also be recorded on Crazy Collection. Why? Because in addition to broken disks, in order to somehow adequately fit the game on a floppy disk, pirates cut out heavy content from the game, namely videos... oh, videos in 1990!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The game is full of cutscenes" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/598/89c/375/59889c3758b3be28ab553e435f6dc75b.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game uses cutscenes and heavily compressed FMV (full-motion video) in key moments, which gives it a cinematic feel. In addition to exploring the castle and solving logical puzzles, there are arcade elements. You need to show reaction - dodge dangers, fight monsters. There is a health bar - if Elvira takes too much damage, she will die. And these deaths are not from dead ends and traps of Sierra quests, but a real role-playing game, with combat, burdened with resurrecting monsters. Starting with this game, very strange and contradictory hybrids of genres begin. Perhaps, Elvira, or rather two games in the series - Elvira: Mistress of the Dark and Elvira 2: The Jaws of Cerberus are pioneers in this genre. First-person view? Arrows, like in a dungeon crawler? And words-actions? Everything is in place!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphics and character animation are well-done. The music and sounds enhance the dark atmosphere. Elvira's humor defuses the situation. The game is atmospheric, with a nonlinear plot and multiple endings. During my attempts to complete the game, I was particularly impressed by the trashy but scary moments, such as the cook with a bloody cleaver looming over the player, melting faces, and a creepy human stew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Weird cook" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/d40/571/ac2/d40571ac202e9d2fa8cd71db607ce3e1.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game's strengths include a well-developed world, interesting characters, and a memorable atmosphere. The weaknesses include sometimes too arcade gameplay, and sometimes illogical puzzles. It should be noted that in the early 90s, the personality of Elvira was certainly impressive - quite a colorful, powerful witch, but she was completely unfamiliar to the layman. And what a surprise it was to learn about Elvira in a TV series only in the early 2000s!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this is an excellent representative of classic adventure games with elements of horror and black humor. Fans of horror and irony, Elvira and the Addams Family will appreciate the unique atmosphere of Elvira!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics' average rating: 65.9%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="dangerous-dave-haunted-mansion-1991"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Dangerous Dave: Haunted Mansion (1991)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dangerous Dave in Haunted Mansion is a 1991 action-platform game that was a hit among school children in the 1990s and early 2000s. By the end of the 1990s, my friends and I would play it after school, competing for time and points, trying to complete levels with one bullet, two bullets, like a double-barreled shotgun - without reloading the entire magazine, to kill certain enemies, or not kill them, or not jump, and so on. In general, the ultimate challenge constructor, what and how you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The first part was still a usual arcade..." src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/f47/83b/2cf/f4783b2cf6380e1c4e57cc26aa47af8b.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the series began in the mid-1990s with the first part of Dangerous Dave (1990), which fit on one 3.5-inch floppy disk (and was drawn with a felt-tip pen DDAVE). In total, no less than disgusting and creepy Dangerous Daves were released four parts for DOS. I can't say that I played the first part much, partly because of its difficulty (ah, and Commander Keen there too), partly because of the disgusting feeling of my own mortality and the disgustingness of this mortality. I am not afraid of spiders in life, but spiders in Dave are simply the standard of disgusting creatures and close-knit constricting horror for me. A completely different matter was the fourth part, because it is more fun with friends, and calmer, and yes and ... and what? The game was even more packed with monsters and cutscenes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="A spider sat on his neck" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/07e/97f/69f/07e97f69f0268588dfdda5a18404f2f4.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the game, you had to explore an abandoned mansion full of zombie monsters, bats, and ghosts. The main character Dave is armed with only a pump-action shotgun, but that didn't stop us from feeling like real badass heroes from 1980s horror movies. Red baseball cap on his head, and off he goes over the fence. Dave is almost like us when we climbed onto construction sites and into boarded-up buildings of an old kindergarten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to shooting, the game featured jumping across chasms, collecting bonuses, and finding keys to open doors. At the same time, the atmosphere of an old castle with flickering torches on the walls sometimes made goosebumps run down your spine. Nervous startle and hold back the lump rising in your throat. Especially memorable were the creepy Dave death animations from zombie bites or falling into a chasm, no matter how many times you lost before!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Black humor of Romero are inseparable" src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/getpro/habr/upload_files/621/05d/fc0/62105dfc0e482ed18554f9d94f725f51.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphics looked great for those years, the gameplay was engaging with its simplicity and dynamism. It was a great game for competitions and spending time with friends. And now sometimes I want to go back to that carefree school time and go through this pixel mansion with Dave again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="waxworks-1992"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Waxworks (1992)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waxworks is an adventure quest with horror elements released in 1992. Although I had seen this game in old publications of the 1990s, I personally did not play it at the time. But recently I finally got to know Waxworks from a clean slate. And, in general, it turned out to be curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Is it... dungeon crawler?" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/750/f27/94a/750f2794a7169c0b5085514b2bd06675.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the game, we find ourselves in a wax figure museum, where we need to go through 4 portals to different dark worlds. These can be a dark forest with witches, a castle with Dracula, a pyramid of a pharaoh, or Victor Frankenstein's laboratory.
The gameplay of the game is primarily about the quest, puzzles, and atmosphere. You need to explore locations, collect and use items, and interact with characters. Along the way, there are logical puzzles and arcade elements such as battles or escaping from enemies. It's funny that in my previous review of dungeon crawler games, I could have mentioned Waxworks as well. After all, it's not just a quest, action, arcade, or even a crawler - with turn-based battles, no matter how strange it may sound. In this game, we will not only have to solve puzzles, but also fight various monsters - zombies, vampires, Frankenstein's monsters. Battles take place in turn-based mode using various weapons and spells. This gives the game the atmosphere of dungeons in the spirit of classic RPGs. To be honest, I don't remember anywhere else I've seen such a pronounced mix of genres. Probably, it's still more of a crawler, but one that was made by quest developers. Which is not surprising, because this is Adventure Soft, the authors of Simon the Sorcerer and Elvira, and, in fact, is the spiritual successor of the series - they have a lot in common, and even more from the crawler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="I'm confused" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/57f/9b3/fb6/57f9b3fb61e220af3ba5764aa87a2e04.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphics for the 90s look very detailed and stylish. Locations in dark forests or castles convey the atmosphere of true horror. Music only enhances the effect of being in the world of horror.
Waxworks is an excellent representative of the genre of adventure RPGs (or point-and-click quests?) with horror elements. In my opinion, the playability of Waxworks is higher in modern times than that of Elvira, although there is noticeably less humor. Quests, battles with monsters, dark atmosphere - I recommend it to all fans of classic 16-bit games!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="last-half-of-darkness-1992"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Last Half of Darkness (1992)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Half of Darkness: Shadows of the Night is a little-known but quality representative of horror point-and-click adventure games from the early 1990s. Forgive me, but for some reason the visual style strongly reminds me of the first parts of King's Quest, if all the light tones were removed and all shades of blue and black were left. In general, this is one of the darkest games of the early nineties, with a completely horror-themed plot and detailed elaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The game is like a transitional stage between text horrors and graphic ones" src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/getpro/habr/upload_files/406/1ba/a41/4061baa41e8e50a449b1a3f24ca96496.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, Last Half of Darkness is three full-fledged games released in 1989, 1992, and 1993. But I would say that each of them is very, very short, so they are more of a single whole, as I see it. My narrative interval does not include sequels, but I should also mention them, namely Last Half of Darkness (2000), Last Half of Darkness: Shadows of the Servants (2005), Last Half of Darkness: Beyond the Spirit's Eye (2007), Tomb of Zojir: Last Half of Darkness (2009), and Last Half of Darkness: Society of the Serpent Moon (2011), which are, in fact, remakes and sequels to the first three classic games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Tomb of Zojir is just as dark as the first games" src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/getpro/habr/upload_files/368/879/6c8/3688796c84623f753ed4e3494ade42ec.jpeg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the action takes place in an old mansion, where the main character comes to visit a friend. However, in the house, he is in for some creepy surprises. From the very beginning, the game creates a dark atmosphere - candles are flickering everywhere, the floorboards are creaking, and the wind is whistling outside the window. As the game progresses, it becomes clear that the house is inhabited by supernatural forces, and the protagonist will have to use his wits to get out of there alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The particularly memorable scenes of the protagonist's death at the hands of ghosts or vampires, if you make a mistake, are set to the sound of a funeral march. The graphics and sound are at a high level for their time, completely immersing you in the dark atmosphere of horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the graphics already looked outdated compared to other games at the time. And some puzzles can only be solved by trial and error. This is probably why the game did not gain wide popularity, despite its interesting plot and atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shall we play knives?" src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/getpro/habr/upload_files/e1e/144/b69/e1e144b6962967eb3cb67905f02cbd1d.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, fans of retro horrors should pay attention to this little-known quest. A creepy mansion with ghosts, breathtaking escapes from monsters - Last Half of Darkness will definitely give you the feel of a classic horror!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playability? Overall yes, although with the existence of wonderful remakes, I would be more inclined towards them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="the-legacy-realm-of-terror-1992"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. The Legacy: Realm of Terror (1992)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Legacy: Realm of Terror is another unique genre hybrid, combining a quest and a dungeon crawler with a first-person view. Another unconventional look at adventure games of that time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, we choose from 4 characters with different characteristics (yes, in a quest - the characters have different characteristics!). At the beginning, the player finds himself in front of the gates of a mysterious mansion, with no memories of himself. Along the way, you will explore an extensive area - the rooms of the castle, catacombs, cemetery, garden, and other dark locations - like in a classic dungeon crawler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The map is drawn automatically - isn't that beautiful!" src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/getpro/habr/upload_files/9bd/830/d65/9bd830d657a63cb14d7978717e148af7.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there are elements of a quest - finding and combining objects, solving puzzles, interacting with characters. I especially remember the episode with the room where you have to dash past swinging daggers - you need to accurately calculate the trajectory - adrenaline is off the charts! In addition, the disturbing atmosphere is created by the musical accompaniment and sound effects - creaky floorboards, creaky ambient sounds...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate mention deserves the plot - many twists and turns, the mysterious past of the protagonist, which must be revealed. The game keeps you on edge until the very end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="You'll have to find the keys, as in any other point-and-click quest" src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/getpro/habr/upload_files/6be/a5c/7b6/6bea5c7b61df86428da679853dde0bcc.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being released in 1993, the graphics look very high-quality and detailed, creating a unique dark atmosphere. The Legacy: Realm of Terror is a masterpiece that combines the best of what was in RPGs and quests of that time. A must-see for fans of retro games!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, this is the very moment to pay attention to. In the 90s, developers were not afraid to experiment and mix the unmixable, often failing and disappearing into oblivion. But at the same time, the horror genre looks a little isolated, it is very noticeable how the developers are trying to break their backs to convey the atmosphere, using tricks - pre-rendered backgrounds (the game looks richer than many crawlers of those years), the game has an explorable map, which is drawn in the visited corridors (no need to fill in a notebook in a cell anymore), and even about the constant attempts to make realistic cutscenes, you are amazed at how it all fit and was distributed on floppy disks...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="dark-seed-1992"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. Dark Seed (1992)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark Seed is a cult psychological horror game released in 1992 that was ahead of its time in its use of live-action cutscenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The mansion looks like it's not from this reality" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/94c/da3/df7/94cda3df7d99fdec6c3f85b79951daa1.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gameplay is classic point-and-click. We explore the house and its surroundings, solve puzzles, and find items. The story follows Mike, an ordinary guy who starts having terrifying visions. His nightmares bleed into reality, and Mike must unravel their mystery to save the world from an invasion of dark forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gameplay consists of exploring locations, searching for clues, talking to characters, and solving puzzles. The surreal visions of Mike create a special atmosphere. It's hard to believe that everything that's happening isn't just a crazy dream. The atmosphere balances on the edge of reality, conveying the disintegration of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Reality and psychedelia blend" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/2dd/29b/9ce/2dd29b9cee21b5e9d7afcbf0c66da7af.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1995, the second part was released, which plays and looks like a real movie. The graphics use pre-rendered backgrounds and live-action cutscenes with actors. The game was one of the first to experiment with cutscenes. The highlight of the show was the story cutscenes with real actors - at the time, this was an unprecedented innovation. The transition from rendered locations to FMV is so smooth that it sometimes seems like the game is entirely made up of video. The sense of presence is incredibly strong by the standards of the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="I have too many thoughts" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/ddb/910/c0e/ddb910c0ead1a6a6a0a4f15f8cd2621c.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark Seed was created by a team led by H.R. Giger, the artist of the film &amp;quot;Alien&amp;quot;. The atmosphere of the game conveys madness and the feeling of a waking dream. A memorable representative of psychological horror in games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual effects, music, and voice acting are all top-notch. It's no wonder that the game was made by a team led by Giger. Dark Seed is still impressive and scary today, ahead of its time. A masterpiece of psychological horror in games!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The line between characters shot on a green screen and pre-rendered backgrounds is sometimes very difficult to see, as if it were a whole film shot" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/d68/529/cda/d68529cda2aeb5ec0225d855f17ed5f0.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't get my hands on the game in the 90s, and that's probably even a plus. I only saw a clipping with a screenshot from the game, and I don't know why that particular screenshot was chosen, because it didn't make me want to play. But today, browsing retro libraries, I got stuck for several hours before I could tear myself away and return to the review. I think that at least if you occasionally dabble in indie horror games in the classic point-and-click setting (for example, this spring I really enjoyed Loretta), then you should not miss Dark Seed. And in general, the psychology of what is happening and the artistic work are impressive at the level of a work of art. Definitely re-play!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="gabriel-knight-sins-of-the-fathers-1993"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers (1993)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I didn't really want to go into detail about this game at first. It's a cult classic that doesn't need any introduction. But I understand that it may not be familiar to everyone, at least due to its age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="This bookstore is like a home away from home" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/68c/84a/f29/68c84af2955d47322a6d705e949efb89.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This point-and-click adventure game was released in 1993 and became a true classic of the genre. Players take on the role of Gabriel Knight, a supernatural investigator who is investigating a series of mysterious murders in New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unique story inspired by New Orleans folklore and voodoo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dark atmosphere, well-developed characters, and numerous plot twists keep players on the edge of their seats until the very end. The dusty atmosphere of searching for the supernatural, offices, typewriters, and the juicy 80s are a visual, sonic, and scripting feast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Each location has its own atmosphere" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/a4a/ebd/ee0/a4aebdee0e229e40ea52f5f231a0ee44.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The locations are rendered as real photographs of New Orleans, which enhances the sense of immersion. Movement between scenes is smooth, and the gameplay is intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voice acting deserves special mention - there are many dialogues, professional actors. This gave the game an unprecedented level of cinematic quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers is a benchmark for the genre, to which people still refer today. Atmospheric story, innovative gameplay, and high-quality execution - there are many epithets for this masterpiece!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The game is distinguished from many in its genre by its cinematic staging of scenes" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/ce6/ad8/c19/ce6ad8c19e689b63564893879e07dc64.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone in my circle who had a computer played the Gabriel Knight series. Of course, my father (for me it was a sequel to Laura Bow, although he tried it and gave up soon), my friends, who did not like quests, but were imbued with the liveliness of what was happening. If not the first part, with magnificent pixel art, then the second, with FMV, crookedly translated by pirates. Surprisingly, the second part (which I didn't have) was brought by my older sister's ex-boyfriend, and we finished it together, sharing tips if someone got stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remake is a good choice if you want to experience the game in a modern way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, I decided to replay the classic (and still pass it, yes, to close the gestalt), and I came across the remake. In general, the remake is beautiful, yes, without the charm of pixel art, but making the game more acceptable for modern players. But the most wild thing turned out to be that the very essence of the game, the atmosphere, the dialogues on the edge, were mercilessly cut out by SJW. You can't make sexist jokes about women, and even more so about voodoo witches (and we know what they are like at least from Monkey Island). And in the end, the plot seems insipid and unnatural. So if you're going to play, keep that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="th-guest-1993"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;11. 7th Guest (1993)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second game on the list, besides Alone in The Dark, that I played myself as a child, and not just played, it was my favorite multimedia game (yes, because it was on CD) after Cyberia. In general, this is one of the first CDs that appeared in our house. The first was the virtual shooting gallery Mad Dog McCree (oh, despite all the negative reviews, I love both of its parts dearly). And the second is the &amp;quot;Seventh Guest&amp;quot;. And this is just the case when games on CD, as in advertising, turned a computer into a machine of ultimate virtual multimedia reality of the new generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The haunted house is now yours. With ghosts" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/cc5/552/a49/cc5552a494e00332da25f7a2b5312236.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 7th Guest is a point-and-click adventure game released in 1993 by Trilobyte. The game was one of the first to be released on CD-ROM and used cutting-edge technologies of the time to create a dark and atmospheric atmosphere.
The 7th Guest uses a combination of technologies to create its 3D world. Most of the rooms in the game are pre-rendered, but they were created with such mastery that they look very realistic. Some rooms, such as the library and the ballroom, are even interactive and can be explored by the player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Cook me, grandma, cabbage soup!" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/eeb/664/9b7/eeb6649b7dee654e0123c1d9efaa7b79.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the pre-rendered rooms, The 7th Guest also uses FMV videos to tell the story. These videos are interviews with characters who were killed in the mansion. They help the player understand what happened in the house and unravel the mystery of the 7th guest.
The 7th Guest is a horror game, and it does its job perfectly. The atmosphere of the game is dark and sinister. The mansion where the action takes place is filled with ghosts and strange noises. The player constantly feels in danger, and even the most ordinary actions can lead to an unexpected frightening event. My first encounter with ghosts on the stairs made me drop all the puzzles and just not turn on the game for another week.
The player in the role of an unnamed guest arrives at the mansion to attend a party. However, when he arrives, the mansion is empty, and the player is trapped. The player must explore the mansion and unravel its secrets to find a way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Clowns always stay without circus" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/1eb/3fd/d41/1eb3fdd41c83af6aae450170f38c2493.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the player explores the mansion, he learns about what happened in the house. Seven guests were killed in the mansion, and the player must find out who the killer was.
The 7th Guest is a puzzle game, and it has many challenging puzzles to solve. The puzzles are varied and require the player to use logic, ingenuity, and observation.
Some puzzles are quite simple, but others can be very difficult. Some puzzles require the player to use objects he finds in the mansion, while others require the player to solve complex logical problems. I will never forget the wild puzzle with the creepy cake. Oh, and the musical puzzle with the piano? Pain and death for a person without musical hearing...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="If the guests ate pies, they washed them down with blood" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/c8a/9cd/1ed/c8a9cd1ed3d0bcda64e6687229a792bf.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 7th Guest is a classic game that still scares and engages players. The game uses cutting-edge technologies of its time to create a dark and atmospheric atmosphere. The game also has a complex plot and many challenging puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 7th Guest is a must-play for all fans of horror and puzzles. I first played The 7th Guest in 1995, and it made a big impression on me. The game was incredibly atmospheric, and I was constantly on my guard. The puzzles were challenging, but they were also very interesting. Today, the game still looks pretty good, although, of course, on large monitors, I would carefully upscale the image, perhaps with filters. On the other hand, the game was remade for VR, and it sounds very cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="doom-1993"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;12. Doom (1993)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doom has been talked about millions of times. Comics have been written about Doom, movies have been made about Doom, books have been written about Doom by foreign and Russian authors. The word itself has become a household name. Monsters have become timeless Easter eggs in games, and a plush cacodemon should be sitting on your couch, and at night you should fall asleep to the reversed howl of Romero's impaled head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Dudu-du-ru-ru-ru! Dudu-du-ru-ru-ruuuu!" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/218/b57/849/218b578497774b0912c7133f34ff6382.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'm not talking about that. Doom was originally positioned by Romero and Carmack as a horror game, yes, an action game, but it's a dark horror, dark corridors with flickering lights, claustrophobia, and loneliness. And the atmosphere of horror depended on your perception, to the extent that you immerse yourself in the role of a brutal soldier. Doom, in my opinion, is not scary because of something supernatural. Even if you fall into a dark room with invisible pinkies, you still have your pistol/rifle and your legs. Doom scares you with something else - that you won't cope, that you'll run out of ammo, that there's no help to be found, and it's useless to wait in the hope that your health will regenerate, like in modern shooters. It scares you with its loneliness, and with the increasing immersion in something you'll never get out of. And you know what? We didn't get out. We fell into Doom, and it stayed with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Too bad for the guy..." src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/getpro/habr/upload_files/f09/f60/7db/f09f607dbce83b34ef707ee744b3835e.jpeg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why I simply couldn't not mention it in this list. I will also deliberately omit those FPS games that could be included for reasons of &amp;quot;horror&amp;quot; of origin, such as Heretic and Hexen, especially since they are primarily inspired by the immortal Doom, both in terms of engine and approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="noctropolis-1994"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;13. Noctropolis (1994)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1994, Trilobyte released the game Noctropolis. You may not have even heard of it, as I didn't in the 90s. The game is set in a dark and atmospheric noir style and tells the story of a group of people who are drawn into strange events in a mysterious city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Pre-rendered, FMV, green screen..." src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/438/261/a5e/438261a5e8d694170c3a99f0d56fb4cc.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noctropolis is a horror game, and it does a great job. The game's atmosphere is dark and foreboding. The city where the action takes place is filled with gothic architecture, dark alleyways, and shadowy corners. The player constantly feels in danger, and even the most ordinary actions can lead to an unexpected frightening event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="I like red more!" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/fa1/afb/354/fa1afb354e911b5da6cdc67a884c2be6.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game's story tells the tale of a group of people who are drawn into strange events in a mysterious city. The protagonist, Jonathan, comes to town for his father's funeral, but soon discovers that the city is not what it seems. He finds an abandoned house inhabited by nightmarish creatures. The player must explore the house and solve puzzles to find a way to leave the city, with his friends who also found themselves trapped inside, and together they try to find a way to escape the city. In the process of the game, the player learns about the characters' pasts and the events that led to their being trapped in the city. He also learns about the city's secrets, which are kept by its residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game features a variety of comics that tell the story of the game and introduce the player to the characters. The comics are done in the style of horror comics and add to the game's atmosphere of darkness and foreboding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The beauty of it all!" src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/getpro/habr/upload_files/46d/884/562/46d8845623977ae046c1ce79d44b8016.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game features FMV sequences that tell about the characters' pasts and the events that led to their being trapped in the city. The FMV sequences are high-quality and add to the game's drama. And, of course, what can be expected from horror and noir, the game features two main female characters: Elizabeth, Jonathan's ex-wife, and Julie, a young woman who also found herself trapped. Both women are beautiful and charismatic, and they play an important role in the game's story and FMV sequences. Beautiful women, in one word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Show is not always good" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/a31/069/84a/a3106984a8b75f341dd34c632026ac69.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noctropolis is not just a game. It is a true work of art. Yes, I was not familiar with it in the 90s, but now, to my surprise, the game looks very powerful, mature, and stylish. It is very difficult not to admire the stylish comics, adult plot, and the work of the artists. Of course, the game has mixed ratings due to the rather strange and clunky controls,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="ecstatica-1994"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;14. Ecstatica (1994)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecstatica is an action-adventure horror game released in 1994 by British studio Andrew Spencer Studios. The second part was released in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="This game is pain. It starts with pain!" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/a31/48d/f79/a3148df79b7df1c6c8fa58281921cea3.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this is one of the closest games to Alone in the Dark in terms of gameplay and spirit. And just as little passable, unfortunately. I don't know why, but the atmosphere of the game seems to me to be more positive and less scary, but the same cannot be said for the monsters. Here they feel stronger and more natural, and this contributes to the difference in the source of fear between these two series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to many games of those years, Ecstatica does not use the usual square polygons for locations. Instead, the technology of ellipsoid mapping is used - characters and objects seem to flow around the surface of the ellipsoid, creating the effect of a smooth organic space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Look inside, run around, survive" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/562/4ba/1fe/5624ba1fe214645f019ab2e7306ac14b.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made it possible to achieve an unprecedented level of detail and realism for interiors in the game. Especially impressive are the large halls of the castle with many columns, arches, niches. The character can freely walk around these objects, examining them from all sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is set in a village captured by some dark forces. Our task is to explore locations, fight monsters and unravel the mystery of what is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is implemented in the classic action-RPG style with a third-person view. The controls are intuitive, the arsenal of weapons is diverse - from swords to crossbows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="I think I'm not on time" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/590/1d4/2c8/5901d42c8bf26c1e0d0cc0ffd987b4fb.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecstatica is remembered for its incredibly atmospheric interiors of a medieval castle, which thanks to the ellipsoid technology looked truly voluminous. This innovative approach has created new possibilities for games in the Action/RPG genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the game may look a bit outdated, and in some places unfair, but due to the use of ellipsoid mapping, the visual component is head and shoulders above early polygonal 3D. So at least out of technical curiosity, I would recommend checking it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="creature-shock-1995"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;15. Creature Shock (1995)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creature Shock is an action-adventure horror game developed by British studio Argonaut Games. The game is set aboard a spaceship in the distant future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something about the source of horror in all games, except Doom, is something mystical (yes, if according to the lore of Doom, hell can also be attributed to mysticism, not pure sci-fi). But in the 80s and 90s there were wonderful horror movies like From Beyond, The Thing, Alien, after all. Well, what can I say, there were such ones too. And, as I mentioned, if Cyberia, a sci-fi action game with wandering through cyberspace between missions, was my favorite game on CD, then Cyberia, making me close my eyes, became a little crooked, with bugs, but even very passable (with the third truth attempt, in the first it was very scary, in the second - difficult, in the third - success) Creature Shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Even the screenshots are disgusting" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/edf/186/3b6/edf1863b60ed45326818ee855ad299b9.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creature Shock is an action-adventure horror game developed by British studio Argonaut Games. The game is set aboard a spaceship in the distant future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is set in 2123. Earth is on the brink of an ecological catastrophe, and humanity is looking for a new home. The spaceship &amp;quot;Amazon&amp;quot; under the command of Captain Sumoka sets off in search of a habitable planet. But the expedition ends in tragedy. In the very beginning, it turns out that a dangerous virus has leaked on the ship, which has mutated the crew into aggressive monsters. The &amp;quot;Amazon&amp;quot; is attacked by an unknown creature, and the ship crashes on a mysterious planet. Sumoka and her team are trapped, and they must fight for survival in a world full of terrible creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shooting at specific parts of the monsters" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/2d6/6a8/0c0/2d66a80c0ee6055300086f5f334d08af.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gameplay is a mix of exploring locations, finding items to solve puzzles, and shooting enemies from a first-person perspective. The arsenal of weapons is supposedly different, but it doesn't matter - you will be forced to shoot at certain parts of the enemies - as a rule, these are disgusting growths that differ in color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="In addition to pre-render video, the game tries to do simple 3D" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/853/04a/b1f/85304ab1fb8c6a08e7bfcfb5ff2a18f5.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphics are decent by the standards of 1994 - well-developed 3D models of the ship, detailed sprites of monsters (hmm, robots? biomechanoids?). The sound design is also top-notch, with music and sound effects that heighten the tension of the action. Today, so to speak, so hard, because the game clearly lacks the pastoral of the same Cyberia, and it looks not very winning. But in its time, if you pay attention to the rating, its three-dimensional monsters and models were much more impressive with their novelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The last enemy, but not the last scene" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/5a6/b86/8c0/5a6b868c01fdf72f72487de19cf6d88d.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creature Shock is remembered for its interesting story and exciting hybrid of action and quest. Space horror in the spirit of the Alien movies came to video games thanks to this project Argonaut Games. Perhaps it was this game that made me learn, however strange it may sound, through the rescue from space worms literally what sticky fear is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="aliens-a-comic-book-adventure-1995"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;16. Aliens: A Comic Book Adventure (1995)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, if the previous game was criticized for the infamous &amp;quot;rails&amp;quot; and the incorrectly killed boss that led to the game being unwinnable, overall it was the ultimate immersion in cosmic horror. But without completely copying the plots of Alien by Ridley Scott. Unlike the next game...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="It's not Nostromo?" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/a1e/03d/1e9/a1e03d1e92993b5d7fef97e7fe5d7400.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a distant galaxy, on a lost planet, stands an abandoned outpost. Once, people lived here, but now they are gone. They were taken. They were taken by xenomorphs. One day, a team of three people arrives on the planet. They must investigate a distress signal that came from the outpost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is led by Lieutenant Colonel Henry Hendrickson. He would rather stay on his ship, but duty calls. Hendrickson and his team arrive at the outpost and discover that it has been overrun by xenomorphs. They must find a way to escape the planet and save themselves from the deadly creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The game balances between pre-rendered and just drawings" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/ac7/fd5/6f3/ac7fd56f371c9b678da45399de09a197.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aliens: A Comic Book Adventure is a first-person adventure game based on the comics about &amp;quot;Aliens&amp;quot;. The game follows the plot of the comic &amp;quot;Maze&amp;quot;, but also includes elements from other comics in the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aliens: A Comic Book Adventure is a dark and unsettling game. The familiar locations from the movie are easy to recognize here. Here are they, the wonderful retro bulbs on the computers, here is the exoskeleton, not very similar to the one that Ripley wore and in which you will have to put on, cocoons of aliens, and everything else is present in a dark color scheme, the appearance of xenomorphs is silent and unexpected, and the disturbing sound effects only exacerbate the feeling of anxiety and fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The game has some strange turn-based tactical battles" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/76b/ebd/fa4/76bebdfa4bd27f5335b1943bd1d5947e.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aliens: A Comic Book Adventure is based on the comics about &amp;quot;Aliens&amp;quot;, which, in turn, are based on the movie &amp;quot;Aliens&amp;quot;. The game includes many elements from the movie, including. Despite the fact that the game is based on the comics, it has some contradictions with the movie. For example, in the game, xenomorphs look a little different than in the movie. In addition, the game has some plot elements that do not match the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The turn-based guards also look strange - too busy, and no, this is not a problem with modern power, but a problem with such animation. Of course, you will have the opportunity to tactically throw grenades into cocoons and shoot a facehugger with a rifle, but still, the game is not about tactics, but about adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father always recommended that I figure it out and finish it, but, I confess honestly, I abandoned it, not having seen the first xenomorph, because the game is very slow and repetitive. Yes, it should be the routine of a space ship crew, but illogical puzzles (in some moments it is not only impossible to predict your death, but after it is hard to understand why you actually died), long movements - all this made me quit the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The game is beautiful, but every action is a cut from the animation. Every time." src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/b38/998/875/b38998875bc8f9a88b517df69d79cc2b.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aliens: A Comic Book Adventure is a game that is worth trying. It is an atmospheric and exciting game that will appeal to fans of &amp;quot;Aliens&amp;quot;. For a long time, it was even one of the few that revealed the universe of aliens (no, let's not talk about Alien 3 on NES). Now, of course, the laurels of primacy rightfully belong to Alien Isolation, as the most correct and accurate game in the universe, organically woven into the narrative of the movie universe. But in the 90s, Aliens: A Comic Book Adventure was the best thing you could play in this universe. But by the end of the 90s, this game lost its status quo...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="bureau-13-1995"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;17. Bureau 13 (1995)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About Aliens, we would probably say now that it is a AAA project, about Aliens: A Comic Book Adventure, that it is, well, based on this kind of AA. Well, okay, A. But maybe the fact is that the more terrifying atmosphere was in trash horror movies like The Living Dead, Hellraiser? B-movies? But who said it had to be zombies? Especially the explosive popularity of Ghostbusters and The X-Files?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="I just have a wide bone" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/ed2/7b8/3ff/ed27b83ff1a5c4466e5a4cc5a6629476.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bureau 13 is a point-and-click adventure game with horror elements, released in 1995. The player takes on the role of an agent of a top-secret Bureau 13 department specializing in investigating paranormal events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game takes place in a small American town where strange things are happening: people are disappearing, objects are floating in the air, and other devilry. The game begins with the Bureau 13 agents being assigned to find and stop an agent who has gone crazy and tried to kill the local sheriff. The agents must act covertly so as not to alarm the residents of the town. Our task is to find out what is really happening in the city and eliminate the threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Almost the entire game is pre-rendered computer graphics, which was not just flat backgrounds at the time, but hours of work by graphics workstations and 3D artists." src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/e99/864/8ee/e998648eeb1b14879f2a957216ca64bc.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game allows you to explore detailed locations such as shops, houses, and hotels. Along the way, you have to interrogate suspicious characters, collect and analyze crime evidence. The game is divided into several chapters, each of which tells a separate story. In each chapter, the player must explore locations, solve puzzles, and avoid dangers to progress further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="You can choose which character you want to play, and each has their own paranormal abilities." src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/0e4/655/4c6/0e46554c6c5bc77fc9b378b46d76b5f4.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The special atmosphere is created by paranormal scenes such as cult rituals or monster attacks. Different characters can use different abilities in different missions, and this is a major plus. High-quality graphics and sound at the time enhance the immersion effect. The game contains malicious references to pop culture and horror movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting fact is that Bureau 13 is based on the tabletop role-playing game &amp;quot;Bureau 13: Stalking the Night Fantastic&amp;quot;, which is a satirical sci-fi/horror game published by Tri Tac Games in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Yes, you will find something... not like that" src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/getpro/habr/upload_files/f9d/295/1b1/f9d2951b1c3f0625a02bcc225066d623.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bureau 13 offers an interesting story for fans of mysterious investigations in the spirit of The X-Files. The game turned out to be atmospheric and promising, although it was not without technical flaws. In general, it plays and feels tacky, even unnatural, both because of the picture style and its inconsistency with the setting. It seems that the authors smelled to make the game as unusual as possible - with a choice of unusual characters, able to solve problems in different ways, using their abilities, but they ran into the limitations of their own and technical capabilities. In general, it is definitely worth the attention of fans of horror detectives, at least in that you are unlikely to have the opportunity to play the role of a detective-psychic anywhere else!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="prisoner-of-ice-1995"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;18. Prisoner of Ice (1995)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game is an excellent example of how to create quite logical, but also dynamic horror-quests. I played this game in the 90s (and it slowed down pretty well) but I finished it to the end much later. Unlike the theme of Innsmouthites and Dagon, which is raped in every first game in the universe of H. P. Lovecraft (Hello, Call of Cthulhu and Sinking City), transferred to endless tabletop games like &amp;quot;The Ancient Horror&amp;quot; (and it's good that they are endless), unlike almost everything related to Lovecraft, this game is clearly inspired by The Mountains of Madness, which can't but please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Hey, xenomorph! Cthulhu Fhtagn!" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/019/123/d2e/019123d2e8da8796f0c521ce9509d3ee.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prisoner of Ice is a point-and-click adventure game with horror elements, released by Infogames in 1995. The game takes place in the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main character is an intelligence agent investigating the disappearance of an expedition in Greenland. He will have to visit abandoned ice caves and face the forces of occultism and Lovecraftian horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Nazis? Here are they! Cultists? What else?" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/641/3a3/5e2/6413a35e26849e614cd7f41f8eae65fd.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game creates an atmosphere of mystery and mysticism from the very beginning. Dark locations, howling wind, disturbing music - all this makes you nervous and look over your shoulder. The scenes of rituals where the hero faces ancient evil are especially memorable, as well as the very beginning of the game, when the expected leisurely quest turns into a chilling escape from deadly tentacles. The graphics for that time look realistic and high-quality, enhancing the immersion effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quest component is also well-developed - the puzzles are logical, they are presented gradually. There are difficult puzzles and arcade elements such as climbing sheer walls. In general, the game is if not a benchmark, then a great representative of horror quests, and certainly a classic of the genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Kill them all! Kill them all! The darkness will descend, the economy will bloom, You just have to read To the end of the Necronomicon!" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/4de/bbe/b4b/4debbeb4bc263cbfee462c9d7dc314e8.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, Prisoner of Ice is a great representative of classic horror quests of the 90s. An exciting plot and a gloomy atmosphere of Lovecraftian horror keep you on edge until the very end. It is definitely worth trying for fans of the genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;19. Shivers (1995)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among many Sierra games and horror adventures, I would like to highlight this one. This game, and especially its second part, released in 1997, unfortunately did not escape the curse of difficult and obscure puzzles, which are familiar from other Sierra games. On the other hand, the atmosphere of dark foreboding, fear, decay, and degradation is the game's main asset. On the one hand, it feels very real, our familiar reality, often due to the beautiful photorealistic graphics, but on the other hand, it makes you put yourself in the shoes of a detective who has been doomed to fall into a supernatural story of psychedelic horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="A night at the museum. Every man goes through this" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/7ce/a13/315/7cea13315c50d396ecaeeeddf3c63d16.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shivers is a horror adventure series from Red Lemon Studios and published by Sierra Online, the first part of which was released in 1995. The main feature of these games is their unusual visual style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first game of the series, you accept a challenge from your friends and spend a night in an old museum. It turns out that the museum is full of strange and creepy exhibits from all over the world and is inhabited by evil spirits. The game is a first-person adventure with slide-based navigation, fully controlled by the mouse. The museum is a huge place to explore, but you'll learn your way around... The game is characterized by extremely detailed rendering of locations and objects in the style of old photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every room in the museum is worked out with photographic precision, creating a truly unique atmosphere of a sinister museum with ghosts. You can spend hours studying various artifacts and interiors. It is clear that the developers were inspired by the example of Myst (to a greater extent) and 7th Guest (to a lesser extent). But one of the key features of the game is the ability to rotate the camera 360 degrees. This feature was quite innovative for its time and significantly improved the gaming experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part was released in 1997. The plot of &amp;quot;Shivers II: Harvest of Souls&amp;quot; continues the theme of horror and adventure. In the game, you find yourself in a small town in the desert where a local rock band has disappeared. Your task is to solve the mystery of their disappearance by exploring the town and solving various puzzles. And the game hints that you have not long to live...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Shivers II: Harvest of Souls" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/0b4/afa/a8e/0b4afaa8e8392cfcd519e62b736ca2eb.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shivers II: Harvest of Souls&amp;quot; offers players to explore various locations, interact with the surrounding world, and solve puzzles to progress through the plot. The game is known for its complex and intriguing plot, as well as its atmosphere of horror and tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Only the dead can help you" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/05c/ac6/0dc/05cac60dc3822e5af41fc64777f8162c.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that a significant part of the atmosphere is created by the main character, his voice, and the translation greatly spoils the feeling of the game. The main character of the game, Dave, was voiced by Sierra Online employee Jason Lindsey. It is curious that now you can easily find him on YouTube under the name &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEFymXY4eFCo_AchSpxwyrg"&gt;Metal Jesus Rocks&lt;/a&gt; - he is both a rocker and a retro gamer. If you are not yet subscribed to him, hurry up to fix this omission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Jason Lindsey, the voice actor at the game ending" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/23d/e7d/2e4/23de7d2e4ec8af7c5c5d7ed9d81e8f58.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shivers series is remembered for its unique style and detailed locations that can be viewed for hours. This is a real interactive museum of creepy exhibits! Definitely worth trying for fans of dark adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1995 was just incredibly rich with horror games. And of course, it was in this year that the sequel to my beloved 7th Guest came out - &amp;quot;11th Hour&amp;quot;. Launching the game in 1996, I happily returned to the still gloomy mansion. Visually, 11th Hour looked great - rendered backgrounds, smooth animation, there were even video inserts, and there were more 3D prerendered animations! Everything is in place. Only about twice as sharp and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Firstly, it's beautiful." src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/eab/7da/402/eab7da402f0466fef21b53e9dd2ceaba.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were definitely more puzzles and logic riddles. I even got confused at first with all these clock mechanisms and mirror rooms. I had to rack my brain, expecting a ghost to pop out at any moment, and that ghosts would be with me like in the first part. But no, there is no horror per se in the game. Yes, the dark mystical atmosphere is still there, but the game has become more of a set of puzzles than a creepy mystical investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Again, chess riddles, and more than once" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/ef4/343/577/ef4343577cc2027b9ca2bfadefeb2b27.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, despite the fact that the game was technically improved, I didn't get very far into it and quickly lost interest. This is probably also due to the fact that the game has actually become more mature and relevant, and not a bright ghost story told in the glow of a flashlight under a blanket. So mature, in fact, that there are explicit, adult scenes, and moreover, there were rumors that there is a full, uncensored version. But to this day, no one has found it or dug up an old dusty hard drive. Well, who knows. The fact is that commercially the game was successful and sold 300,000 copies, and is still sold to this day, with a GOG version of the game available since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Deadly love" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/326/0fe/e93/3260fee9394ccb6af0454204bcefa90a.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, it’s probably best to get acquainted with the game in conjunction with 7th Guest, expect a more adult plot, but with the understanding that the scenes that may have seemed provocative at the time of release now still look mundane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="d-1995"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;21. D (1995)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't say the same about the following game...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, in childhood I held in my hands a disc with the game D, but never once launched it. My father imposed a strict ban on even touching it. Why? On the disc there was only the boring letter &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; on a black background. In books there were vague mentions of the plot, very vague, unlike the usual walkthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, such mystery only stoked childish curiosity. I wondered what was so special about it that it was banned in some countries. But I never violated my father's ban, although the temptation was great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The whole game is pre-rendered" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/f49/62e/215/f4962e21569edef2df2baeab9d812bdf.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;D&amp;quot; was developed and released during the period when FMV (Full Motion Video) games were at the peak of popularity. It was a time when developers were looking for new ways to utilize the increased power of computers to create more cinematic and engaging gaming experiences. &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; stood out from most other FMV games of that time – not just drawings, but computer graphics – from rooms to objects and characters, stood out for its unique approach to narrative and gameplay – it’s more of a film than a Myst-style slideshow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Sometimes you have to be nimble and do some QTE" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/73c/02c/145/73c02c1453022db2407e9a17d6a851ae.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; players control a character named Laura who is trying to find her father in a sinister hospital. Her father, Dr. Richter Harris, committed a mass murder and barricaded himself in the hospital. To find out what happened, Laura has only two hours, and if the game is not completed in that time, Laura will remain forever in the sinister hospital. The game offers many puzzles and riddles that players need to solve in order to advance the plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="That infamous human flesh eating scene" src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/getpro/habr/upload_files/317/75e/812/31775e81200940c7b135889b2ce363ec.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game's creator, Kenji Eno, added scenes of violence and cannibalism to make the game more vivid and memorable. However, he assumed such content might be too extreme for censors or publishers. Curious fact, the project lead Kenji Iino had to be sly. Initially, the game was created without any plot at all, and Iino kept it secret even from other team members. When development was complete, he sent D for review (without plot and violent scenes). He intentionally sent the master disc to the US manufacturers later - thus, a version without violent scenes passed review, and the final version of the game went into production and D was not censored, though it did receive an &amp;quot;adults only&amp;quot; rating. In Japan, the game became one of the best-selling PlayStation games in 1995. On PlayStation, success exceeded expectations, so much so that Sony failed to release enough copies of the game for PlayStation - pre-orders exceeded what they could fulfill. As a result, less than a third of the projected quantity was sold. In Europe, the game sold well but was censored because of its brutal content. In the UK, for example, the game was banned from sale until some of the most controversial scenes were removed. This sparked further debate about censorship in video games and what themes and materials are suitable for the medium. Today this may seem strange, given the level of detail, and the conditionality of what is happening, but one must not forget that in 1995 this level of CG was incredible and almost hyper-realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="I'm your father, Laura." src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/3bd/cfd/d5b/3bdcfdd5b8ebb106e770c71ea8f3a8f8.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; is an example of how video games can provoke debate and discussion about censorship and content. Despite its controversial reputation, it remains an important and influential game in the survival horror genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GameFan called the game a &amp;quot;masterpiece&amp;quot;, although they usually didn't like FMV games. They praised &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; for its innovation and creativity, calling it &amp;quot;the best FMV game that will probably ever be made.&amp;quot; At the same time, Game Informer included D in the list of the worst horror games of all time. Such a contradiction. Like many FMV games, D was ahead of its time. And once again made me think about how the value of forbidden fruit is not in the filling, but in the fact of the ban. Personally, I would have avoided this game if not for such a juicy backstory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="phantasmagoria-1995"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;22. Phantasmagoria (1995)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my attempt to translate the Russian text about Phantasmagoria into English:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If D slyly infiltrated the market and blew up the public, then Phantasmagoria trampled all moral principles and boundaries with the grace of an elephant in a china shop. Very effective, but very clumsy. This is the most ambitious FMV horror project and one of the biggest games in video game history, spanning seven CDs. Yes, sometime in '96-'97 the game fell into my father's hands, but again in a wonderful pirated version on two disks. At the same time, as I remember, you could only buy some of the disks, and then buy the remaining two later. From a game consisting entirely of video, pirates managed to cut out or compress the video and make the game more compact, but...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Phantasmagoria is an interactive movie, with cinema-quality visuals" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/97b/430/cb7/97b430cb7bdd0d6415be25aeed718c09.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth was that if you look at screenshots of D for PS and PC, you'll notice a significant difference - the PC version looks worse, more compressed, darker, the interface - all to fit the game on a disk, and so that the not-so-impressive capabilities of computers of those years could handle full-screen video. But this did not apply to Phantasmagoria. The game was unplayable on a 486 and required a Pentium and preferably not just a 2x CD-ROM. Of course, you can find the minimum requirements and say that 8 MB was enough for everyone... but... if you want to play comfortably, not in slideshow mode with stuttering sound, yes, a 486 was too little. In short, the game was doomed to commercial failure due to its size and price. And in our pirated copy with the missing disks, in the '90s, as it turned out, additional disks may no longer be available, and... I never completed the game in the '90s, and never saw the most horrific scenes for which the game was banned wherever possible, accusing the brutality of video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="In the game you can die in many different ways, not to mention those characters who will die without your help" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/a2a/94e/b81/a2a94eb8175a04fb3281609fc5f03a5e.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, sometime in the early 2000s, a licensed re-release of the game with a Russian translation came out in a small paper box, into which all 11 disks were stuffed. And... yes, for me this is the most monstrous game ever released on PC. Because no matter how brutal games are, no matter how scary past and present horrors are, like some Dark Pictures Anthology, they still involve 3D models. And only in Phantasmagoria - people. Yes, of course it's filmed footage, but you control that footage yourself, and it's your heroine who gets torn to pieces, turned into mush...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Pray this is just a dream" src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/getpro/habr/upload_files/169/a66/a18/169a66a18bb1d831bd2740a4af4a8b27.jpeg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uniqueness of the game was the combination of live actors in video clips and classic point-and-click gameplay when exploring locations. The transition between video fragments and overlaying prerendered graphics was almost seamless, allowing for incredible immersion in the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the story is good, it manipulates the feeling of the reality of what is happening and the acceptance of real horror. To summarize the plot briefly, a young couple, Adrienne and Don, buy an old castle in hopes of starting a new life. But soon they discover that the castle harbors a grim secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="You can't hide from this nightmare" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/d3a/66a/b59/d3a66ab59f1cd730f5a851ab8a1b6188.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adrienne begins to see strange things, and soon realizes that an evil spirit dwells in the castle. Don, meanwhile, absorbed in renovating the castle, does not believe Adrienne and thinks she is simply overworked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Adrienne learns more about the castle, she realizes that her life and her husband's life are in danger. She has to find a way to stop the evil spirit before it takes their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adrienne begins to explore the castle, hoping to find answers to her questions. She finds old books and documents that tell of the castle's dark past. She also finds strange objects that she suspects are connected to the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="This meaty &amp;quot;spirit&amp;quot;" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/28a/11b/3d3/28a11b3d3f46d391e70e9f2858ecc769.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Adrienne gets closer to unraveling the mystery, the evil spirit begins to pursue her. He appears in her dreams and visions, and he tries to intimidate her. Adrienne must gather all her strength to resist the evil. She has to use everything she knows to find a way to stop the evil spirit and save her life and her husband's life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of particular note are the many shocking and bloody scenes that caused scandals in the gaming press of those years, but at the same time strongly attracted players. The atmosphere of horror was maintained throughout the game. The developers created a truly sinister story about a writer moving into an ancient manor with a dark past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The game is unprecedentedly bloody, adult, but at the same time it does not cross the line into outright erotica" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/ea7/ff8/d47/ea7ff8d473040602929353ce7cb9378c.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Phantasmagoria has become a real milestone in the development of the horror quest genre, offering players a cinematic story full of mysticism and horrors. Definitely worth a try for fans of dark quests!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Curiously, a year later Sierra released a sequel that few people know about. And which, apart from the title and FMV, is in no way connected to the first one. According to reviews, the game is also worth attention, although it does not have cult status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="i-have-no-mouth-and-i-must-scream-1995"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;23. I have no mouth, and I must scream (1995)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, I was fascinated by this game. I read all the reviews, which were overwhelmingly positive, and I saw the screenshots, which were deeply mysterious. The game was a quest, but it was also very strange. I wanted to experience it for myself, but I never had the chance. Perhaps there was never an English translation, perhaps because the game is more adult and philosophical than a fun slasher for a night of scares. Who knows? Perhaps one day I'll finally get around to playing it fully, as it is considered a true work of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is a graphic adventure game developed and published by Cyberdreams in 1995. The game is based on the short story of the same name by American science fiction writer Harlan Ellison, first published in 1967. It is a first-person game in which the player controls one of five characters. The player must explore a dungeon, solve puzzles, and avoid danger to progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Each new character's arc is a new twist in the narrative and a changing setting." src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/af6/855/23d/af685523dfbe96375160f71042c9905b.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot, being based on a science fiction short story, is quite unconventional. In 2042, humanity was destroyed in a nuclear war. The only survivors are five people who have been locked in an underground complex and tortured and abused by AM, an artificial intelligence created to destroy humanity. AM forces the people to play cruel games for its amusement. It also manipulates them to fight each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="There is nothing human in machines. But if there is in humans, why do they obey?" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/fd5/c71/c03/fd5c71c039cc5826481d882c8523462b.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is divided into five chapters, each of which tells a separate story. In each chapter, the player must complete certain tasks to complete the chapter. I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is a dark and disturbing game. A game that is unlike anything else. It combines elements of horror, drama, and philosophy. The game explores the dark side of humanity and how easily we can give in to temptation and cruelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="I will break you, AM." src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/fae/ed6/710/faeed6710874154e3d15805a9859dc41.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the game's strengths is its story. The story of five people who have been locked in a dungeon and tortured and abused is both gripping and heartbreaking. Players will empathize with the characters and try to help them escape this nightmare. At the end of the game, players are faced with a choice that has serious consequences. This choice forces players to contemplate the nature of good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="ripper-1996"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;24. Ripper (1996)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ripper is a point-and-click adventure game with horror elements from the legendary Take-Two studio. The game is set in the near future, in the year 2040. It hints at its cyberpunk affiliation, it is juicy and noir, but at the same time it tries to be as realistic and understandable as possible for a 90s layman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Ripper today looks like a mix of Blade Runner and a 1950s detective story." src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/8c6/542/a03/8c6542a03e0bb0677fe422b3581c4169.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to play the demo of the game when it came out. Since the game is also an FMV story interspersed with puzzles on pre-rendered locations, the game was apparently too large (a full playthrough takes about 5 hours) to be translated and released on multiple discs by the pirates of those years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main character is a reporter investigating a series of brutal murders committed by a maniac who calls himself Jack the Ripper. The game allows you to explore various locations and interact with a large number of characters in search of clues. To be honest, it is much more interesting to unravel the tangle of relationships and intrigues between the characters, as they are so well-developed, than to rush and hurry to investigate the murders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The morgue is beautiful, but it's better not to see what's on the couch." src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/cf5/ac7/58d/cf5ac758d8d93f34fec92ee92a6c3ec0.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game features rather naturalistic video clips of the murders of the maniac's victims, which are memorable for those years. The detective plot allows you to delve into the psychology of the serial killer and the motives of his crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game features several plot variations and various endings depending on the player's actions. This adds replayability and motivates you to play Ripper several times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The game also features clumsy but action-packed scenes. After all, someone has to put things in order in a woman's head!" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/2f6/93e/9a6/2f693e9a6de2b5cc147e81ca67388f9a.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this game is a successful hybrid of a cyberpunk film and a detective, diluted with puzzles and a bit of shooting. The gripping atmosphere of the maniac in the game keeps you on edge until the very end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, years later, you can (and should) learn about the story - the game is available in full digital form. The game is not so much scary as it is deep and breaking stereotypes and your expectations of a familiar plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="frankenstein-through-the-eyes-of-the-monster-1996"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;25. Frankenstein: Through the Eyes of the Monster (1996)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father recommended that I play this game back in the day, because, first of all, it is based on the classic novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus by Mary Shelley. And secondly, it tells the story of the monster from his own perspective. The protagonist of the game is Philip Warren, who was falsely accused of killing children, including his own daughter, for which he was sentenced to death by hanging, but was torn to pieces by a mob of townspeople before his execution. Then Dr. Victor Frankenstein appears, who assembles Philip from pieces (not only his own) and breathes new, revived life into him. The plot is banal and familiar, if not for the fact that we are going to play as the monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The game is beautiful and well-made, like Myst." src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/f63/326/a21/f63326a21b5406672531c1019e4a7762.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this is a point-and-click adventure game released in 1995 by Amazing Media. The atmosphere of the game is dark and disturbing. The player explores gloomy and empty locations, such as Frankenstein's castle and the cemetery, collects items, and solves puzzles. In general, the game is very familiar and conservative, contains a lot of FMV inserts and pre-rendered or digitized photos of locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game also explores the themes of loneliness and alienation, which makes you think about complex questions such as the nature of good and evil, the role of the creator and the creation, and loneliness. This gives the player the opportunity to see the monster not as an evil creature, but as a being who has been rejected by society and is looking for love and acceptance. Interestingly, depending on the player's actions, you can get different endings. But for the good one - to revive your daughter - you need to try very hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="For most of the time, you will wander through monotonous corridors and look for items to solve puzzles." src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/2be/4d0/87d/2be4d087dcaf535808b38a4f7f244886.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, I kind of regret not having played the game back then, as the plot and, most importantly, the look at the plot, are not banal. On the other hand, a fairly adult plot, with a philosophical canvas, is significantly broken up by a sluggish narrative. Of course, this is done, first of all, to create an atmosphere of alienation and loneliness, but often the puzzles are difficult and illogical, you will have to walk around and look for pieces of puzzles, rummaging through the locations with the cursor. Of course, in the style of the genre, but seeing the first FMV, you expect to immerse yourself in the plot and the film, but in fact, the lion's share of the game is switching switches, searching for items, and wandering through monotonous labyrinths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the verdict? If you like slow-paced, atmospheric, but at the same time games with &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; fear, where you can methodically solve puzzles for hours, then this game is for you. In addition, the approach to the narrative is very curious, and I would rather recommend that you familiarize yourself with the game and understand whether you will continue to play it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="realms-of-the-haunting-1996"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;26. Realms of the Haunting (1996)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven't had any strange hybrids in a while, have we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Realms of the Haunting&amp;quot; is not just a game, it is art embodied in digital form. It represents a unique combination of genres, including elements of adventure games, first-person shooters and horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The gun lies at the very beginning of the game" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/5ad/7d8/074/5ad7d8074e547aa0692ddff6b4a8c9df.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &amp;quot;Realms of the Haunting&amp;quot; you will explore a sinister mansion, encountering creatures from other worlds and solving complex puzzles to uncover the secrets of this place. All of this is accompanied by high-quality sound that enhances the sense of horror and tension. You have to explore the mansion's gloomy corridors, collect items and use them to solve puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game's plot revolves around Adam Randall, who comes to an abandoned mansion after his father's death. But as soon as he crosses the threshold, he enters another world full of demons and mysteries. He has to uncover the secrets of this place and find out what happened to his father. One of the most memorable scenes in &amp;quot;Realms of the Haunting&amp;quot; is the encounter with the demon Belial. This powerful creature from another world poses a serious threat to Adam. Fighting him requires not only quick reflexes, but also a good understanding of the game's mechanics. Another impressive scene is the meeting with Adam's father in the form of a ghost. This is when the plot of the game begins to unfold, and the player starts to understand what is going on. The very pleasant and convincing acting in the FMV scenes only adds to the atmosphere and elaboration of the plot...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The plot in the game is presented through FMV inserts" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/df1/993/6b4/df19936b4dc4cd305eeb5ec807de9bae.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I couldn't shake the feeling of the strangeness of what was happening. On the one hand, it's a quest, with searching for items, with great FMV scenes, the clashes with enemies are not so much surprising, as they were in Elvira, as the format that this happens in first person, with a hand growing out of the chest, like in Doom, with shootouts that really feel like shootouts. In general, the game is beautifully and well made, with nice graphics that immerse the player in a 3D environment with many details that many shooters of those years would envy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the negatives, I can note an extremely unusual and unintuitive interface and keys for modern players. As in early games, it uses arrow keys and angle brackets instead of WASD, strafing and running exist, but there is insane sensitivity in the game. To interact with the interface, you need to press additional keys on the keyboard (U)se, and to turn your head you have to hold down two mouse buttons at the same time. Yes, in 1996 there were no standards yet, but now such a thing can easily catch fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Puzzles in the game are frequent, but do not overshadow the gameplay" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/79f/313/77d/79f31377dd644a10e1fa74b92e58df20.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, this game is difficult to evaluate as a game. It is neither a quest to find items, nor a shooter with hordes of monsters, nor a crawler with wandering down corridors. In general, it is more like modern first-person horror games than anything of those years. For 1995, such an approach to details and gameplay is a real claim to being a work of art, and it is very unfortunate that the game is not very well known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realms of the Haunting is a game that will not leave you indifferent. It offers a unique combination of genres, a complex plot and an engaging atmosphere that will make your journey through this world unforgettable. It's strange, unusual, uncomfortable and beautiful. In short, if you're looking for something complex, dynamic and unusual tonight - this is definitely your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;27. Harvester (1996)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't play or even hear about this game in the '90s. But in today's selection, it's one of the most interesting, provocative and unusual games in my opinion. It's definitely worth checking out. Primarily because of its psychologism, absurdity, possibilities and contradictions. Just like with Darkseed, I got stuck in the game for a few hours, and then went on to flip through walkthroughs on Youtube to immerse myself a little more in the context and write a slightly more detailed review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The game is full of absurd black humor" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/3c3/932/706/3c393270632bbd0dc166a68599a3815d.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a gameplay perspective, Harvester is a classic point-and-click adventure. Most of the time you will be exploring the town, interacting with its inhabitants and solving various puzzles. Unfortunately, the controls in the game are quite inconvenient, the consequences of events are hard to anticipate, and sometimes without a walkthrough it's difficult to understand what is required of you, especially if you, like me, are not an expert in quests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game represents a unique combination of black humor, violence and absurdity, which makes it truly unique. The game has no boundaries in morality or narrative, yet it is not gore for the sake of gore, not violence for the sake of violence, but violence and absurdity for the sake of challenging morality and for philosophical reflections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="If you wish, you can kill all the inhabitants of the town" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/f92/1f2/d75/f921f2d759f54c6a359a771da58a2662.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main feature of Harvester is its atmosphere. From the first minutes of the game you are immersed in a world that seems simultaneously familiar and completely alien. The town of Harvest is full of strange characters and even stranger events that keep you tense all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game's plot revolves around Steve, who wakes up in the small town of Harvest with no memories of his past. The whole town seems strange and unreal, and its inhabitants behave like characters from a cheap 50s TV show. A small, quiet American town with an outwardly ideal way of life that actually conceals many dark secrets and human vices. Steve has to interact with the town's strange inhabitants, fulfill their requests, while encountering violence, cruelty and surrealistic black humor along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The inhabitants of the town are mildly put, strange, hand-picked. Or is it Steve's perception?" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/152/d25/498/152d2549877381774d08fde7a2ae20af.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main features of Harvester is the ability to choose Steve's behavior style from benevolent to aggressively cynical. This affects the plot development and generates many ending variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game contains a lot of shocking content, including violence, explicit sexual scenes, and black humor. This caused a lot of controversy and scandal in the 1990s, but is now seen more as a stylized aesthetic. The graphics are well done, mimicking 1950s-60s American films. The sound, the musical accompaniment are also stylized to the music of that era and enhance the atmosphere of an absurd retro nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Trash is thy name - from dialogues to surroundings" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/e0b/f31/119/e0bf31119ef00964070c7159c74929f1.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Harvester is a cult game for fans of Tarantino-esque black humor. The shocking content is a deliberate artistic device, not an end in itself. The scene in the family restaurant is especially memorable, where the player can choose how exactly Steve will kill the waitress - with an axe or a cleaver. At the same time, the surrounding guests and the owner calmly continue breakfasting, and the corpse is removed as if nothing happened. The absurd black humor is simply off the charts. Another highlight is the opportunity to perform a ritual sacrifice of a virgin in an occult temple. The gameplay offers to choose how exactly to deprive her of innocence before the sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such scenes caused (and still cause for some) shock and indignation. But this is how Harvester parodies the hypocrisy of society and takes it to absurdity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Pity, truth, fear, absurdity, cruelty?" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/afe/1c5/b46/afe1c5b46297a9941a0222de1a872223.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even decades after its release, this game continues to evoke conflicting feelings. It shocks and repels, but at the same time lures and intrigues with its nightmare atmosphere under the guise of a 1950s ideal. It shocks with variability and multiple endings. That it has no good endings, no choice in principle that you would make yourself - &amp;quot;it just so happened&amp;quot;, although you can choose absolutely anything. The game allows you to do not only what is taboo in other games (to be honest, I will refrain from listing), but also allows you in principle not to do so, and to be a victim in both the literal and figurative sense of the word. Despite its flaws and contradictions, Harvester is a game that is worth trying. Its unique atmosphere, interesting plot and original gameplay make it one of the most memorable games of the 90s. It's hard to imagine something similar coming out today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend that those interested read a detailed review of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="blood-1997"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;28. Blood (1997)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Harvester, I think almost all FPS genre fans in the '90s have heard of Blood. Like Harvester, the game allows you to unleash your share of violence, albeit with ostensibly righteous (righteous?) goals. At the time, I personally didn't care for the game precisely because of the excessive brutality and relatively outdated graphics. The game looked like a generic Witchhaven or Duke Nukem, even though Quake II and Hexen II had come out at the same time. But now this seems like a matter of taste, because the game isn't really about that, it's about the slasher, blood and horrors of a dark cult, and it's just fun!..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Dance until you're dead" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/702/24d/7e3/70224d7e3ef1e805e8f626865bc71163.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood is a classic FPS game that still delights players to this day. The level design, animation, movement, weapons arsenal and monsters are organic, elaborate, and wonderful, especially in the context of their time. The weapon arsenal in Blood also deserves a separate mention. From shotgun to dynamite, from pitchfork to &amp;quot;Tommy gun&amp;quot; - each weapon has its own peculiarities and tactics of use. The levels in Blood are especially notable. They are ingeniously designed and full of secrets, which makes exploring them an exciting activity. In addition, the game has many different enemies, each of which requires its own approach in combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The red splashed, splashed" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/f84/642/721/f84642721c5b863d2d2c984076514dc6.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that Blood is a classic game, it has not aged. The movement in the game is fast and responsive, and the animation is smooth and detailed. In 2021, a remake was released, &amp;quot;Blood: Fresh Supply&amp;quot; - this is a new version of the game that offers improved graphics and support for modern screen resolutions. However, despite these improvements, &amp;quot;Fresh Supply&amp;quot; is unlikely to lure all players away from the 1997 version, because the classic has a special charm... A mixture of brutal bloodiness with black humor, a unique atmosphere that is hard to forget. Blood does not shy away from its bloodiness. Enemies explode into pieces, and blood splashes everywhere. But this is not just meaningless cruelty. All of this is accompanied by black humor, which gives the game a special appeal. The protagonist, Caleb, constantly mocks his enemies, making the game even more amusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Everything is convenient except the pitchfork. But the pitchfork is brutal" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/c9a/a34/c88/c9aa34c88f384dc66102fde981754254.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Blood is a great game that combines brutality, black humor, and great level design. If you love FPS games and aren't afraid of a little blood, this game is for you. I, for example, have revised my attitude and enjoy playing it purely for fun :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="sanitarium-1998"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;29. Sanitarium (1998)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sanitarium&amp;quot; is a psychological horror point-and-click adventure game developed by DreamForge Entertainment and published by ASC Games in 1998. The game is set in an asylum, where the player controls a man who has amnesia and must explore the asylum to uncover his past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Get that through your head, you're not the chosen one" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/775/e72/38c/775e7238cdfd1af219f79bc52c03f27f.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is presented in a series of interactive puzzles that the player must solve to progress. The puzzles are often challenging and require the player to think outside the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sanitarium&amp;quot; is distinguished by its unique, surreal atmosphere and deep plot. The game can be quite difficult and demanding, but for those who love horror and adventure, it offers a unique and engaging gaming experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Who's been missing - come to the carnival" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/b1b/cce/a18/b1bccea18fee3a8a7586e8cd08370a55.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it's worth talking a bit more about the plot. It is built around the theme of madness and the perception of reality. As you progress, you enter different worlds and meet characters who are projections of the protagonist's memories and fears. Revealing the true essence of what is happening is one of the key plot twists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the game is interesting for its puzzles, many of which are based on associations related to the theme of madness. For example, in one of the worlds, you need to build a &amp;quot;logical&amp;quot; chain of absurd statements by a character to get a key clue to progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The game is a real horror fun" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/adc/fea/e61/adcfeae613368598499c2c59073ed277.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, it is worth noting the psychology of the characters and the moral choices that the player has to face. This gives the plot depth and emotional engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the game still looks wonderful and relevant, in my opinion, and does not give the impression of something outdated. The world is very beautiful, full and atmospheric. But, as in the case of, for example, Planescape Torment (I think they are both atmospherically and visually similar), the game world is very specific and unlike anything else. There is probably no game to compare Sanitarium with - it is too eclectic, too original, like a work of art, fragile and ambiguous to perceive. Despite this, &amp;quot;Sanitarium&amp;quot; remains a classic of the genre and still attracts new players with its unusual approach to storytelling and puzzles. This is another game from today's list that, in my opinion, will not become obsolete and should be preserved on the shelves of the museum of digital history for posterity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="legacy-of-kain-1999"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;30. Legacy of Kain (1999)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legacy of Kain is a series of action-RPG games set in a dark fantasy world, developed by Crystal Dynamics. The first game was released in 1997 and quickly gained cult status thanks to its engaging story and atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Not all the dead have nothing to lose" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/8c8/f4e/745/8c8f4e74508a034732bc5dc05ada0274.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first game, you play as Kain, an aristocrat who is turned into a vampire after his death. Kain is driven by revenge against his murderers, but he can also save or doom the world of Nosgoth, depending on the player's actions. The moral dilemma facing Kain forces the player to consider the cost of salvation. The series' antagonist, the Soul Reaver, is also interesting. He initially appears to be a villain, but the player gradually comes to understand his motives. The ambiguity of the characters is a defining feature of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gameplay consists of exploring Gothic locations, fighting monsters and enemies with a sword, claws and blood magic. Kain develops his strength and abilities as he levels up. The ability to transform into a wolf or bat for more effective attacks is particularly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Tired vampires smell like dog" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/53e/546/6c4/53e5466c464deb456ba1007ce388533b.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting the difficulty of the enemies, especially the bosses. In battles, you have to use a lot of dodging and vampire abilities to win. This makes the battles truly exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the game progresses, Kain gradually learns about the ancient curse that plagues this world. The protagonist is drawn into a massive conflict, where he must make a difficult choice about the fate of the entire empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dark atmosphere, memorable characters, well-developed story, and engaging action all made the first part a true classic, spawning numerous sequels and fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Bloodletting is not only beautiful, but also restores health" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/afd/9df/25c/afd9df25cd706edd1b912f01b1cdc705.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1999, the sequel Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver was released. I played both games when they were released, but I admit that I didn't finish either one. Personally, for me, Legacy of Kain, released in 1997, was the first hack-and-slash game. Yes, of course, Diablo was released in 1996, and I managed to play it and appreciate the theme of Tristram, but I couldn't fall in love with the mechanics in either the first or the second part (although I finished both). Unlike Legacy of Kain, where, in addition to slicing enemies, which is quite varied, there were quite a few puzzles in the gameplay, there was more plot, narrative and dark atmosphere of vampire aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="alien-vs-predator-1999"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;31. Alien vs. Predator (1999)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aliens Versus Predator is a first-person shooter game released in 1999 that combines the universes of Aliens and Predator. Players can choose to fight for the humans, aliens, or Predators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Nightmare facehuggers in place" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/fad/c1b/18f/fadc1b18f9d4bc19d67ec61e42aa058a.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gameplay varies depending on the chosen race. Marines have access to firearms, Aliens can climb walls and ceilings, and Predators have powerful melee weapons with claws and a spear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="There are no vertical surfaces exists for xenomorphs" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/9ef/fc4/38f/9effc438f44eec13d4c917fb5025fb62.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main modes are a single-player campaign for each race and multiplayer battles. The campaigns are well-developed in the spirit of the films, with an atmosphere of hopelessness and horror from fighting an unknown enemy in the darkness of space corridors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphics are impressive for the 1990s, with detailed models of Aliens and Predators and well-designed locations. The sound design is also top-notch, with the growls of Xenomorphs causing goosebumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing as Colonial Marines, players must rely on firearms such as pistols, rifles, and shotguns. Ammunition is limited, so players often have to resort to hit-and-run tactics using cover. The Marine story is about investigating the disappearance of people on a planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing as Xenomorphs, players have access to fun abilities such as climbing walls and ceilings and attacking with their tails. There is no weapon, only claws. In general, playing as Xenomorphs is probably the most interesting, but it is also the easiest to get lost and get motion sickness when the floor, ceiling, and walls are mixed up. The story of the Xenomorphs tells of the infection of colonists and Marines with eggs. It is necessary to make them serve the Queen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Death from behind is the most effective" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/c83/a9e/43c/c83a9e43c9b863ae1b7841aa49cc7663.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predators have a powerful arsenal of melee weapons such as claws, spears, and a laser gun. Their campaign is about hunting Xenomorphs for trophies and recognition in the clan. The Predator's tactics are to attack from stealth. Predators are probably the easiest to play, but they are not as intuitive as ordinary fragile Marines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In multiplayer, players can play as all races, choosing the appropriate tactics. For example, Xenomorphs are effective in ambush attacks. And Marines can create defensive turrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Invisibility and spear are strongest combo of Predator" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/upload_files/4c6/824/87c/4c682487cd7f4c51a863f057425b6b3b.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, as not a big fan and skilled FPS player, appreciated the game already in the early 2000s. Unfortunately, it was not as popular as CS or Quake III, but it was still played, and it was fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, AvP has become a benchmark for multiplayer shooters in the setting of a science fiction horror. This game is still considered one of the best in the Aliens vs. Predator universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="and-more-and-another-one"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;And more, and another one...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list includes games that were either iconic for me or that I was not familiar with but that I found to be the most interesting. I am sure that I missed something important and more significant for you, so I ask you to share in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I specifically did not separate the first game in the series from the sequels (except for 7th Guest and 11th Hour), and I also did not take ports from other platforms (ok, except for Legacy of Kain, but in the 1990s I had no idea that the game was from the PS, and I found out only in the 2000s). Otherwise, Resident Evil and Silent Hill would definitely have made the list, and if you remove the platform restriction and take into account emulators...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it somehow seems inconvenient for me to completely ignore games like BloodNet, Dark Eye, Nocturne, Veil of Darkness, Amber, Killing Time, Congo, Shadow Man, the Jack in the Dark promo spin-off, and others...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it will still turn out that I bypassed horror games before the 90s, but included Maniac Mansion in the list of games from the 90s... And what about text-based horror games?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a word, you can't get everything, especially considering that such masterpieces as American McGee's Alice, Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption, and KISS: Psycho Circus appeared in the 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the games can be found on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gog.com/"&gt;GOG&lt;/a&gt;, so you can launch the games without any problems in a few clicks. The average rating is given as the arithmetic mean of the ratings from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.mobygames.com/"&gt;MobyGames&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.igdb.com/"&gt;IGDB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was listing 31 games, I thought about the questions that adults in the 1990s did not think about. How reasonable is it to expose children to provocative and scary content, to protect them from cruelty and violence? Now we are adults. Ratings have been invented for our children - &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEGI"&gt;PEGI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board"&gt;ESRB&lt;/a&gt;, laws are being passed at the state level to care for children so that they grow up with a healthy psyche, as once was the case when there were no harmful computer games. And you know, that's right. A child should not have the same experience that we had (okay, I'll be talking about myself), I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/nightmare_on_elm_street"&gt;Freddy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/friday_the_13th_part_1"&gt;Jason&lt;/a&gt;, who killed people, traumatized me. I saw, albeit fake, but fountains of blood and sausages turned inside out instead of entrails. Violence is scary. Violence is bad. That's the conclusion I came to. When I played Cannon Fodder, and it was a lot of fun, because &amp;quot;War has never been so much fun,&amp;quot; I mowed down hordes of enemies, set fire to other people's houses, and it's cool to feel stronger and more right, your green people are better than other people's blue ones. But my hill was filled with white crosses, and I was really sad that my Corporal Jops was no longer with me, but he threw grenades so well. Because war kills. War is absolute evil.&lt;/p&gt;

And how many and whom do people who have not played them traumatize? Hardly. Nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
